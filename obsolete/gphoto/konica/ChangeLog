	* Fix bug in konical_qm100.c which overrode the 
	  name of the serial port, with internal default.
	
1999-09-27    <EdLegowski@pobox.com>
	* Change default speed to 57600.
	* Add progress indicator during downloads.
	* Miscellaneous code cleanup.
	
1999-08-17    <EdLegowski@pobox.com>
	* Close cvs-bug incidents 1622, 1664 and 1667.

1999-08-16    <EdLegowski@pobox.com>
	* Add shell-script 'gettraces' to aid the gathering 
	  of trace data for debugging the camera protocol.
	* Add several switches to qm100 CLI utility, useful
	  mostly for debugging.

1999-08-08    <edlegowski@pobox.com>
	* Reworked the getPacket code in transmission.c 
	  to make it tolerant of errors.  Reliable use 
	  of higher baud rates should now be possible.
	* Added short headers/descriptions to most 
	  functions.  This should make it easier for others
	  to understand the code.
	* Added TODO file to track possible extensions and
          enhancements.
	
1999-08-04    <edlegowski@pobox.com>
	* Added code to distinguish between C20 and C30 
	  models, since the packets for getPicInfo and 
	  getThumbnail are different.  Both models now
	  work.
	* 'Take Picture' is fixed, but does not (yet)
	   have the ability to set flash, quality, etc.
	* Cleanup/clarify packet definitions in defs.h
	* Clean up packet handling in transmission.c;
	  specificaly, rename 'qm100_sendNullCmd' to
	  qm100_getCmdTermination,  which tries to 
	  read a command-confirmation packet.  Previously,
	  we were sending a dummy command request, when
	  the camera was trying to send us the 
	  confirmation packet - it worked, but only 
	  because the camera actually rejected our
	  transmission, which we didn't notice.
	* Change default baudrate to 9600
	* Put check into open.c to treat 'Trace on'
	  in konicarc as 'Trace ~/.gphoto/konica.trace'.
	
1999-07-20    <edlegowski@pobox.com>
	* Fixed segmentation fault in transmission.c
	* Fixed abrupt termination with 'Done and exit'
	  message while retrieving thumbnails or pictures.
	* Added qm100 as a target in the Makefile.  This
	  is a command-line utility which supports all
	  camera options, and is useful for debugging,
	  and for automating via shell scripts.
	* Added configuration options for baud-rate,
  	  pacing, and tracing.  These can be controlled 
	  via shell environment variables, or via entries
	  in ~/.gphoto/konicarc. For qm100, command-line
	  switches are also provided.  Descriptions are
	  provided in 'konicarc.sample'.
