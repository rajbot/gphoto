This module isn't fully implemented (yet).

You should be able to access a file with something 
like "camera://my_camera/directory/filename.jpg", 
where 'My Camera' is the name of the camera you
specified in the preferences dialog of GnoCam.

Currently, you are able to get previews with 
something like "camera://previews@my_camera/".
