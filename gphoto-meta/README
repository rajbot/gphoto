What can you do with gphoto-meta?
========================================================================


1. run bootstrap.sh - if you downloaded gphoto-meta via CVS
===========================================================

If you don't have current autoconf, automake, gettext and libtool
installed (i.e. you run into trouble), run bootstrap.sh with the 
"--tools" parameter and it will download, build and locally install
all these tools in a working version.

bootstrap.sh downloads sources for all subprojects from CVS into 
cvs-orig/ - if this hasn't already been done before. If you already
have CVS sources in cvs-orig, you can have bootstrap.sh update to
current CVS by running it with the --update parameter.

Then bootstrap.sh initializes the build system in a copy in cvs-src/.

It configures the copy, builds distribution tarballs in 
dist-files/ and installs into dist-root/ if necessary.
Unfortunately, (due to usage of pkgconfig), we have to install
libgphoto2 before gtkam or gphoto2 will even configure.

You may want to run bootstrap.sh using at, if you want to avoid having
to press enter for each gettextize invocation:

	echo $PWD/bootstrap.sh | at now


2. run compileinstall.sh
========================

Unpacks the source packages from dist/ in src/ and installs them
to ${instroot} (default is inst-root/, but the dir can be given as
parameter to compileinstall.sh):

   compileinstall /absolute/path


3. run "autogen.sh; configure; make dist"
=========================================

Creates a gphoto-meta-VERSION.tar.gz package containing all the
packages found in dist. This package can then be distributed and
used to build everything using compileinstall.sh.


========================================================================
How does it work?
========================================================================

The file "cvs-module-list" contains a list of CVS modules to download
and compile. Every line describes a CVS module with its location,
name, the revision to download and some options describing how to
process it.

========================================================================
What is still missing?
========================================================================

- install autoconf, automake, gettext, libtool, pkg-config in adequate
  versions before building anything
