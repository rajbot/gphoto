What is gphoto2-ftp?
--------------------

gphoto2-ftp is a ftp-server that makes accessible the files on your 
digital camera available over FTP.

What adjustments to the setup of my system are needed?
------------------------------------------------------

Here on my Debian/unstable system, I added "gphoto2-ftp 21/tcp" to 
/etc/services and "gphoto2-ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd 
/path/to/gphoto2-ftp" to /etc/inetd.conf. It works.

Root? Isn't this dangerous?
---------------------------

Probably yes. Suggest something better.

Ok, I have installed it. Now what do I need to do?
--------------------------------------------------

lutz@lutz:~$ ftp localhost
Connected to lutz.
220 FTP server ready.
Name (localhost:lutz): Directory Browse
230 Connected to camera.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> cd /home/lutz
250 Changed to directory '/home/lutz'.
ftp> get gimp-menu.png
local: gimp-menu.png remote: gimp-menu.png
200 PORT command successful.
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.

Why doesn't 'ls' work?
----------------------

Short question, short answer: It isn't implemented yet.
