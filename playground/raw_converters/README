I have created this directory, intending to put into it some tools for 
experimenting with conversion of raw camera output. The purpose of these 
tools is to make it easy to experiment, with code which the user can 
change without great effort and without lengthy installation procedures 
in order to try to get better results output from a camera. 

Tools which make it easy to re-do the same task repeatedly, under 
controlled circumstances, with small changes from one iteration to another, 
are essential for doing such things as figuring out a decompression 
algorithm or, otherwise, just for improving the quality of image output 
from a given camera or camera library. By construction, tools which perform
a speedy conversion from raw to finished format can do the same task over 
and over again on the same raw file, with small changes in the program 
between one test and the next. 

The first subdirectory of this directory is for the JL2005A cameras. These
cameras do not use image compression. However, there does seem to be a need 
and, one hopes a possibility to improve the output quality. Thus, I am posting 
this code in order to make it possible for others to share in testing this 
particular camera, should anyone like to do so. 

I have created similar test environments for other cameras in the past; I 
think that the time which I spent in doing so was well spent and has led to 
great improvements in several existing camera drivers. I may in the future 
put some of those tools in this directory, too. If anyone else working in the 
gphoto project has done similar work for some other cameras, I would hope to 
see that work publicized here, too.
