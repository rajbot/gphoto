This module isn't fully implemented (yet).

You should be able to access a file with something 
like "camera://My Camera/directory/filename.jpg", 
where 'My Camera' is the name of the camera you
specified in the preferences dialog of GnoCam.

I can't get nautilus to compile, so I am missing
a browser to actually use this module. 

Let's wait and see...
