Introduction

When a user selects to make an HTML gallery, they must
first have the index opened, and the images they want
in the gallery selected.  Then, they type in the name of
the gallery in a text entry, select a gallery theme,
and specify the output directory.

Here are the gPhoto HTML engine tags:
                
	#GALLERY_NAME#          the name of the gallery
        #GALLERY_INDEX#         page name of the thumbnail index
        #DATE#                  current date
        #THUMBNAIL#             thumbnail image w/link to picture
        #THUMBNAIL_FILENAME#    name of thumbnail image
        #THUMBNAIL_NUMBER#      number of the thumbnail
        #PICTURE#               <img> tag w/picture
        #PICTURE_FILENAME#      filename of picture
        #PICTURE_NUMBER#        number of the picture
        #PICTURE_NEXT#          next picture's html filename
        #PICTURE_PREVIOUS#      previous picture's html filename

Here are the 4 files that make up a gPhoto Gallery "Theme":

        /usr/share/gphoto/gallery/<theme name>/index_top.html
        /usr/share/gphoto/gallery/<theme name>/index_bottom.html
        /usr/share/gphoto/gallery/<theme name>/thumbnail.html
        /usr/share/gphoto/gallery/<theme name>/picture.html

Any other files that are in the /usr/share/gphoto/gallery/<theme name>
directory are copied directly to the output directory specified by the
user, so you can place "button" images, and background images in
the theme .html files, and it will be preserved in the gallery
output... java, images, javascript... you can use any of that in the
gallery theme..

Here are some examples:
--- index_top.html ---
(printed at the top of the index page)
        <html><title>Default Gallery Theme</title>
        <body>
        <h1>Welcome to the #GALLERY_NAME# HTML gallery.</h1>
        <p>Yes! this is extremely bland and boring, but is just an example of
        how to create gallery themes in gPhoto!
        <p>
        The following gallery was created on #DATE#:
        <p>

--- index_bottom.html ---
(printed at the bottom of the index page)
        <p>
        Please click on one of the images to view it, and then you can use
        the previous/next links to move between images.
        <hr>
        <i>name of this page: #GALLERY_INDEX#
        <br>gPhoto development team
        </body></html>

--- thumbnail.html ---
(this is placed in each thumbnail "cell" in the index table)

        <table>
        <tr><td>#THUMBNAIL#</td></tr>
        <tr><td>This is thumbnail #THUMBNAIL_NUMBER#</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Filename: #THUMBNAIL_FILENAME#</td></tr>
        </table>

--- picture.html ---
(printed in each of the pictures' individual full-size pages...)
(notice how next/previous use .jpg images as links. they are copied from
the theme directory to the output directory automatically)
        <html><title>Picture #PICTURE_NUMBER# in #GALLERY_NAME#</title>
        <body>
        <a href="#PICTURE_PREVIOUS#"><img src="previous.jpg"></a>
        <a href="#PICTURE_NEXT#"><img src="next.jpg"></a>
        <a href="#GALLERY_INDEX#"><img src="index.jpg"></a>
        <p>
        #PICTURE#
        <p>
        Image Filename: #PICTURE_FILENAME#
        <p>
        <a href="#PICTURE_PREVIOUS#"><img src="previous.jpg"></a>
        <a href="#PICTURE_NEXT#"><img src="next.jpg"></a>
        <a href="#GALLERY_INDEX#"><img src="index.jpg"></a>
        <hr>
        <i>The default gPhoto Gallery
        </body></html>
