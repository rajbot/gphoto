The installation procedure should be quite simple:

0) You must have the gphoto2 libraries installed.

1) ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

   If you have difficulties building on FreeBSD, try --disable-nls
   or install the gettext port (cd /usr/ports/devel/gettext && make install).

2) make install

   This installs the software and documentation into the proper
   directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
   package system instead, follow a) for RPMs.

   a) make rpm

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.
