==Things to rename==
CameraFilesystem.GetFS -> GetFs
USB->Usb
namespace LibGPhoto2 -> Gphoto2 (perhaps GPhoto2?)




==General Todo==
* more size checking.  See if we can do comparisons with enum's?  If not with compiled sources, perhaps by hand.
* integrate my testing libraries
* perhaps split non-oo functions into a sub-namespace, and then expose a high-level object oriented namespace as GPhoto2?
