         Requirements for the next generation of gphoto code
========================================================================



========================================================================
Introduction
============

This document lists (possible) formal requirements for an upcoming
next generation of libgphoto. These requirements result from
deficiencies of the existing codebase noted in the last few years.

This document just lists unordered requirements. It does not make any
decision or give any preferences on which requirements can be
reasonably addressed and which will need to be dropped. "Wishlist" may
have been a better title. :-)

The "Rn" numbers of the requirements are intended to be unique and
permanent. If it is necessary to remove a requirement from this list,
mark it with "(deleted)" like "R4. (deleted) All use must be reported
to the authorities". Add new requirements using unused numbers.


Consider this file a Wiki
-------------------------

Anybody with SVN write access is codially invited to add their own
ideas to this list.

If we get a wiki some time soon, we can still migrate this document to
the wiki, but we need a place to note ideas *now*.



========================================================================
List of Requirements
====================


R1. "Native" APIs for common languages such as C, C++, Python, C#, Java
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

There must be APIs conforming to the "native" conventions, i.e.
  * for C++, the API should follow STL patterns (STL lists, C++ classes)
  * for Python, the native list and class mechanism should be used
  * etc.

The design of the core library should keep those bindings in mind.


R2. C ABI must allow changes in data structure size
---------------------------------------------------

Changing the size of internal data structures must not cause C ABI
breakage.

Consequently, bindings building on the ABI also cannot break.

Cf. [4]


R3. Device database
-------------------

The list of devices must be changeable without recompiling the code.

This requires the device database to be external from the code, and
for the device database to contain all information regarding device
capabilities and settings specific to certain driver-device
combinations.

Over time, there have been multiple ideas: [1] [2] [3]

Possible solutions: HAL (XML based), other XML-based, gphoto
proprietary format, ...

Issues: Resources for parser and database (RAM, storage, CPU cycles).
        hal + dbus + expat + gphoto will become a little much for an
        OpenWRT box.

Idea: Store everything in HAL, create lightweight format for
lightweight parser for low-memory systems, and on desktops directly
use HAL. Cf. libipoddevice (can only be given device by HAL and then
operates on it). banshee stores audio player formats in HAL. Other
people store lists of exploding batteries or known-broken
laptops/drivers in HAL to warn users... so our data should be storable
as well. We could put the device selection someplace around
libgphoto_highlevel in R9a, and create a heavy HAL+DBUS+everything
version for desktops and a light version for light systems.


R4. Memory Management semantics
-------------------------------

All C functions must have a well-defined, clearly document, and
consistent policy regarding which part of the code is responsible for
free()ing which piece of memory.


R5. C data types
----------------

Data buffers must be handed over using "void *" pointers. Otherwise,
some code will rely on the char being unsigned, some signed, and
alltogether it creates a mess and myriads of unclear cases, as we have
seen in libgphoto2.


R6. Compiler Warnings, language standards
-----------------------------------------

A certain language standard must be defined as required, and strictly
adhered to.

The code must compile without warnings with the strictest compiler
settings possible. E.g. for gcc, it should be something like

   CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror --std=c99 -pedantic"
   CXXFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -Werror --std=c++98 -pedantic"


R7. Library architecture
------------------------

Compatibility across systems with different degrees of linker
sophisitication. This implies a clear linking graph without cycles,
similar to this (library names are symbolic):

        application
        |    |    |
        |    |    V
        ?    |  libgphoto_highlevel
        |    |    |
        ?    V    V
        |  libgphoto_drivers
        ?    |    |
        |    |    V
        ?    |  device_driver
        |    |    |
        V    V    V
      libgphoto_basic

[ libgphoto2's camlibs are linked against libgphoto2.so, which is the
  library loading and thus linking to the camlib. ]

This may also allow to statically link all required drivers into
libgphoto_drivers for special applications.


R7a. Event-/Stream-based driver API
-----------------------------------

R7a is a more detailed variant of R7. It has not been checked against
reality, especially in the forms of:

  * linking feasibility on non-ELF systems
  * how (possible) camera/DAP capabilites compare to API restraints

        application
        |    |    |
        |    |    V
        ?    |  libgphoto_highlevel
        |    |    |
        ?    V    V
        |  libgphoto_drivers
        ?    |    |
        |    |    V
        ?    |  device_driver
        |    |    |
        V    V    V
      libgphoto_basic

In this architecture, the libraries' jobs would be something like

   libgphoto_basic: common infrastructure
     * logging, error reporting
     * serial, USB, Firewire, IP, ... port access
     * everything gphoto specific a device driver may need to use

   device_driver: device driver
     * Reads data from device, immediately passing the data on to a
       callback function
     * Writes data to device
     * Executes special functions on device
     * Does not need any knowledge of a "filesystem" or the like.
     * Event driven, events being
        - function calls coming in via libgphoto_drivers
        - data packets coming in from the device port

   libgphoto_drivers: device detection and abstraction
     * autodetects devices
     * provides access to devices identified specifically
     * loads the appropriate driver
     * provides device abstracted access to the device using the
       driver (using the exact API the device_driver exposes)
     * No higher level functions building on the other functions.

   libgphoto_highlevel: higher level functions
     * higher level functions building on the lower libraries,
       e.g. callback functions writing to files on disk or to sockets
     * This may be the part to be replaced in "fat" bindings to
       languages other than C.

If implemented properly, this architecture should allow handling
asynchronous arrival of data packages from multiple cameras.

Interesting points:

   * async/event based USB interface requires non-existing libusb 1.0
   * async/event based architecture should integrate with other event
     based architectures, e.g. daemons running select() in the main
     loop, or GUI software with a UI event loop.


R8. Device Functionality
------------------------

If at all possible, support all functions of all devices on the
market.

  * File access:
     - list files/folders
     - get single files
     - get all files (there are cameras which do not support getting
       single files)
     - put single files
     - remove file
     - create folder
     - remove folder
     - mark files as downloaded (if supported)
  * Camera remote control:
     - change camera settings (exposure mode, whether/how to trigger
       the flash, lens zoom, image file format, image size, ...)
     - switch remote viewfinder on/off, transmit its images
     - initiate image capture (to camera storage, or to host computer)
  * Digital Audio Player:
     - remotely control playback, perhaps?


R9. C ABI versioning
--------------------

Make proper use of library versioning (soname) and possibly symbol
versioning (highly system specific, no system generic tool support).

A real issue here is cross platform compatibility and the (perceived
or real) lack of tools to solve those cross platform problems. It
looks like GNU (Linux, Hurd) supports symbol versioning including
incompatible changes, Solaris supports symbol versioning without
incompatible changes, some BSDs have taken to support versioned
symbols as well, and other systems rely on a changed
SONAME. Supporting all these systems with a single codebase is not
going to be trivial.

Use corresponding mechanisms for other languages.

Cf. [4], [5].


R10. C API versioning
---------------------

Make proper use of C API versioning. Header file location possibly

    ${includedir}/gphoto3/gphoto/{highlevel,drivers,basic}.h

and header use like

    #define GPHOTO_API 2
    #include <gphoto/highlevel.h>

Use corresponding mechanisms for other languages.

Cf. [4].


R11. Parallel build system
--------------------------

Parallel builds (make -jn) would be nice in the age of more-than-one
core CPUs.

For automake, this requires a single top-level Makefile.am and then
include foo/bar/Makefile-files for every directory. And properly
defined dependencies, of course.


R12. Network addresses
----------------------

If some piece of code works with network sockets via IP, it must
support both IPv4 and IPv6.


R13. Code quality
-----------------

Check these papers: [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]


R14. Supported platforms
----------------------

Define a list of explicitly supported platforms:

  * operating system
  * compiler
  * C runtime
  * build tools
  * other things

including the respective versions.

New releases will at least have to be test built for these supported
systems.

There may be another set of platforms which is supported on an
if-someone-sends-a-patch basis, and a set of platforms we are by
design incompatible with.


R15. API Documentation
----------------------

Every API function and data type must be documented. There must be API
docs must be generated from some source, probably via doxygen or a
similar tool. API docs will be published with each release.

The documentation of a function or data type must contain the version
it was added in.


R16. Transition strategy
------------------------

The way for libgphoto2 users to adapt to the revised API must be
well-considered and documented well.


R17. Code rewrite plan
----------------------

All rewriting of our code must be actually feasible within the
constraints we face, the most confining constraint probably being
manpower.

It should be possible to actually use the code for tests from quite
early in the process - otherwise no one will use it, and it will
possibly die before it has a chance to catch on.


R18. Ask our users for input
----------------------------

For this purpose, users are:

  * authors of software using libgphoto2
  * packages shipping gphoto2 in distributions
  * end users


R19. Driver/device capabilities, testcase driver
------------------------------------------------

All drivers have different capabilites as their devices also have
different capabilities. Therefore both these capabilities must be 
exposed to the application, and applications must be able to handle
widely different sets of capabilities.

It may be useful to write a testcase driver for testing applications.
That testcase driver would simulate a device, or multiple devices
supporting subsets of its total capabilities.


R20. Storage API
----------------

In many respects, camera protocols are just file storage over
RS232 or USB. That part of the API must cover

  * directory/folder handling
  * reading/writing files
  * handling metainformation, e.g.
     - audio track author, performer, song name, etc.
     - associated thumbnail image, audio annotation, ...
  * pure file level access
  * filesystem properties, such as total FS size, used, and free


R21. Remote control and capturing API
-------------------------------------

TBD: Camera remote control, capturing images, tethered shooting,
     audio player control, other device control, ...


R22. Device settings
--------------------

Some kind of device settings are available on more than one kind of
device. These deserve more than driver specific support. Examples:

  * name of device owner
  * device date/time (including timezone nightmare)
  * battery level
