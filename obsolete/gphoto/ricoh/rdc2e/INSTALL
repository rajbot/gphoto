Here is the list of things to do:

1. Untar the bundle with: 'tar -zxvf rdc2e-0.7.tar.gz'

2. 'cd rdc2e-0.7'

3. Type './BUILD' - This will prompt you for your default serial
   port, and then compile the program.

4. As root type 'make install' - this will install the programs in
   /usr/local/bin, and the man pages in /usr/local/man/man1.

To uninstall everything, as root do a 'make uninstall'.
