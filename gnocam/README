GNOCAM
------

GnoCam was born because I felt a need for a small but powerful frontend to 
gphoto2 for the GNOME desktop.

GnoCam actually is a quick hack, assembled by code from gtCam and several
GNOME applications like gedit, gftp, etc. See TODO for a list of things that
remain to do.

If you feel that GnoCam is worth being developed further, send an e-mail to me.
