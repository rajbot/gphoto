Compiling and installing from SVN
=================================

If you are starting with a SVN checkout of libgphoto2-python, you will need
a number of tools to initialize the build system:

   * autoconf
   * automake
   * libtool

Then you can run "autoreconf -is" in the top-level libgphoto2-python
directory, and after autoreconf is finished, you will have the same
files a released source tarball has.


Compiling and installing from a released source tarball
=======================================================

Compiling and installing also requires a number of tools:

   * Python
   * Pyrex
   * C compiler

For simple cases where you don't need any special compile options, you
want to use the system's default libgphoto2 and you can afford to
install into the system's standard Python site-packages directory,
compiling and installing is as easy as:

   $ python setup.py build
   $ sudo python setup.py install

For more complicated build cases or out of soure tree builds, you can
use the "configure" mechanism with all the options it offers:

   $ ./configure --prefix=... PYREXC=... LIBGPHOTO2_CFLAGS=... LIBGPHOTO2_LIBS=...
   $ make
   $ make install       # possibly as root, depending on the prefix

For more details on the available options, run "./configure --help".
