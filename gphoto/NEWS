   Casio Qv-7000SX with IrDA
   
   Linux Kernel hacker Dag Brattli [3]<dagb@cs.uit.no> announced on the
   [4]gphoto-devel [5]mailing list today that he will write a gphoto
   driver for the Casio Qv-7000SX digital camera with Tran-P.
   
   Dag Brattli is the founder and maintainer of the [6]Linux-IrDA
   project. The first Linux-implementation of the IrDATM standards was
   included in the 2.2 kernel.
   
   IrDATM (Infrared Data Association) is an industry standard for
   infrared wireless communication. Most laptops sold today are equipped
   with an IrDA compliant infrared transceiver, which enables you to
   communicate with devices such as printers, modems, fax, LAN, and other
   laptops, as well as digital cameras.

   Negative response from Canon Australia

Subj: Re: A PS-A5 / Unix possability???
From: [10]gpaterson@cscpo.canon.com.au
To:   [11]raymond@one.com.au

Dear Mr Newman

I'm sorry, but Canon Inc are still not releasing the requested
information for the PowerShot A5 Digital Camera (it may well be company
confidential or 3rd party developed protocol).

The product has been designed and marketed for the Microsoft Windows and
Apple Macintosh platforms only.

If your requirement is still solely for the Unix / Linux environment I
can only suggest selling or trading in your PS-A5 on another product
that is qualified for your required platform.

I'm sure that this is not what you wanted to hear, but I don't believe
that there are any other options within Canon.

regards
Glenn Paterson
CSCPO, Canon Australia

   We urge Canon and competing camera manufacturers to release open
   specifications now, and the several million users of free operating
   systems to not buy camera products from Canon until they provide
   specs.

   gphoto 0.3.2 RPMs and tarball
   
   Paul Jenner [12]<psj@mustec.eu.org> has built new RPMs and tarball CVS
   snapshots of gphoto-0.3.2. gPhoto is still in heavy development, and
   will hopefully reach a stable 0.4 soon.

   DC210 support for gPhoto
   
   Brian Hirt [16]<bhirt@mobygames.com>, the developer of [17]KDCPI, a
   command line perl program that interfaces with the Kodak DC210,
   reported to [18]<gphoto-kodak@gphoto.org> [19]mailing list that he has
   downloaded the gPhoto source and started working on a gphoto library.
   
   A development version of the DC210 library is in gphoto/kodak in GNOME
   CVS.

   The gPhoto roadmap
   
   Bob Paauwe [20]<bpaauwe@bobsplace.com> has scanned of the
   [21]gphoto-devel@gphoto.org [22]mailing list archive and organized a
   new [23]todo list by version number.
   
   The next stable development release (version 0.4, as all stable
   release will use even number versions) sure will have a lot of new
   features.

   Nikon considers gPhoto support
   
   Phill Hugo [24]<phill@gnu.org> has spoken to Nikon as part of gPhoto
   and have a few leads on developing a driver for them.
   
   Please mention gPhoto and this site, if you mail them.
   
   It is always a great help for potential camera customers to pressure
   companies into support our work BEFORE you give them your money.
   
   Many companies simply don't have time to look at the issues involved
   unless there is an financial incentive to do so. The more open we can
   make them, the better gPhoto can be and the more enjoyment you'll get
   from your camera.
   
   Phill has added the file ``[25]CONTACTS'' in CVS, that contains a list
   of company members who you can write to asking for GPL drivers or open
   specifications. There is also a sample letter in ``[26]LETTER''.

   Alan Cox plugs gPhoto
   
   Today Linux kernel hacker Alan Cox [27]<alan@redhat.com> comments
   gPhoto in his [28]development diary:
   
     "...It also happens to be supported by gphoto which is very cute,
     very slick and very buggy (but it doesnt claim to be finished). It
     crashed every download until I attacked it with gdb and fixed my
     copy up."
     
   Some of the driver problems will be sorted out with his help.
   
   Thanks, Alan.

   autoconf in CVS
   
   Paul S Jenner [29]<psj@mustec.eu.org> has committed the final autoconf
   patch to CVS along with Gary Ross' [30]<gdr@hooked.net> Casio changes
   that came with it.
   
   Now it is finally in CVS you can build gphoto with autoconf provided
   you have [31]GNU autoconf, [32]GNU automake and [33]GNU libtool on
   your system. To build simply run:
   
./autogen.sh
make
make install
