This directory contains a driver for the Sony DSC-F55E camera.
The driver currently manages still images only.


To build the library and stand alone execute make from the shell prompt

	$ make


after make completes, there will be an executable called rsony in this
directory.


When using as a command line utility, set the cameras serial port using the 
following shell variable.

	$ export DSCF55E_PORT="/dev/ttyS0" (replace with required port)

To select 115200 baud set a shell variable as below.

	$ export DSCF55E_SPEED=115200

This is used in both the standalone and library versions.

The export command is used with bash, other shells have their own method of 
setting variables, refer to the help for your shell.



I would be interested in reports on various platforms, or any problems that
arise from the use of this library/utility.
