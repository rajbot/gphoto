The program show_sonix_raw will convert a raw file from any one of the known 
cameras supported in libgphoto2/camlibs/sonix into a viewable PPM file. The 
file will be saved, and the image contained in the file will be displayed in 
an X window. To close the program, close the window. The output file will be
saved. The name of the output file will look like sonix***ppm. An image file 
created by libgphoto2/camlibs/sonix will have a similar name, but with a "." 
before the ppm. The reason why the filenames put out from this program are 
slightly different is that the output of this program and of the sonix camera 
library will be close together if in the same directory, whereas at the same 
time there will be no name conflicts. As one of the purposes of the 
show_sonix_raw program is to try to improve the image processing for the Sonix
cameras, this feature will therefore allow easy comparison of the image 
resulting from two different processing routines. 

The program is written to accept raw files which were the output of 
gphoto2 --get-all-raw-data 
or 
gphoto2 --get-raw-data (number or range of numbers, or file name(s)). The  
raw files will have names which look like raw_sonix***.raw in which *** is the 
number of the photo. A sample script file should also be present here, which 
will successively run the program through all of the raw files in a directory, 
provided that the numbering of those raw files is consecutive and starts with 
001. Just put the script and the show_sonix_raw executable in the same 
directory with the raw files and run the script. The first image will be 
displayed and will remain displayed until you close the window in which it sits.
At that point, the second image will be displayed, and so on until you have 
opened all of the photos.  

There are several Sonix SN9C2028 cameras, and they have different features:

First, there is an option about the camera's resolution. For, embedded in 
each raw file is the information about whether the image is low or high 
resolution, relative to what the camera will do. But unfortunately the 
information about what is the camera's highest resolution is not present. Thus,
for cameras which have a maximum resolution setting of 352*288, and a lower 
resolution setting of 176*144, please use the
command 

show_sonix_raw -qvga (name of raw file)

and if the camera has its highest resolution setting as 640*280, then do not 
use this option. The max resolution of the camera will then be presumed to be 
a default setting of 640*480, and information embedded in the image will then 
determine whether that particular image is 640*480 or 320*240. 

As far as I know right now, the cameras which will do 352*288 resolution will 
not need any other options but this one, so that no other options may be used
if the -qvga option is used. If this causes any problems or is inconsistent 
with your camera, please let me know. 

Second, the 640*480 cameras are divided into two classes, those which have a
header of length 8 bytes in the raw files, and those which do not. A camera 
which has such headers in the raw files will need the option 

show_sonix_raw -useoffset (name of raw file).

It is easy to tell if the camera needs this or not. Just try 

show_sonix_raw (name of raw file)

and if the output comes out looking very strange, then try the option. 

Third, the 640*480 cameras which require the option -useoffset are divided in
turn into two sets. If by trying the -useoffset option you got a recognizable 
image, but the image is upside down and color-shifted, then please try 

show_sonix_raw -useoffset -invert (name of raw file)

and, one hopes, you will get good results. 

Please do note that each option is listed above. For example, there is no 
option built in to do both -qvga and -invert, or -invert without -useoffset 
given first, or any other combination which is not listed explicitly above. 


If you encounter any SN9C2028 camera which seems to require other processing 
options which are not incorporated here, or if there are any other problems 
remaining with the raw conversion program which prevent it from doing its job, 
then please let me know.
