    **** THE "gphoto" PROGRAM IS OBSOLETE ****


    Use libgphoto2 and one of its frontends:
       - gphoto2 for the command line
       - gtkam, digikam, flphoto for X11













































This is a development release of gPhoto, the GNU digital camera utility.

DESCRIPTION
	gPhoto is an universal, free GTK+ application that will allow
	downloading, saving, and manipulation of images from several 
	different digital camera models, or from the local harddrive.

	gPhoto has a basic command line interface, which is handy, 
	if you want to set up a web camera, and use gphoto in a 
	script, e.g. with Perl/PHP.  

	gPhoto sports a new HTML engine, that let's you create your
	gallery "themes" (HTML with special tags), and publish images 
	to the web.  A directory browse mode has also been implemented.

	gPhoto supports a wide array of digital camera models.

IMPORTANT NOTICES
	- Remove your old one from your $HOME/.gphoto/ directory
	  and then run gphoto and select your camera model.
	
	- For info about HTML gallery theme support, read THEMES (included).

FEATURES/CHANGES:
	* Directory browse mode.

		In the "select model/port", select "Browse directory"
		then, whenever you click on "get index", a file selector
		pops up to ask you which directory to open. all images
		in the directory are opened, and thumbnails are generated
		for all of them... it's really handy if all the images are
		already archived on your hard drive and you want to find
		one... also, this can be used in the HTML gallery!

	* Live Camera! real-time camera preview

		This feature lets you see what your camera sees, 
		and trigger a snapshot if you like what you see.

	* HTML gallery generator

		The addition of this is a BIGGIE!  This is really the first
		step in making gPhoto "more" than just a digicam utility.
		there is a "Default" theme included... to install it, 
		you MUST do a "make install" to copy all files to the
		correct location ($PREFIX/share/gphoto/gallery/) after
		you "make" the package
	
		Using it:
			* Get the index first
			* Select the images to include in the gallery.
			* Go to "plugins->HTML Gallery"
			* Type in a name for the Gallery
			* Click on "Default" for the theme
			* "Change" the output directory to where you want it.
			* Click on "create"

		It will go through the motions, and tell you when it's
		done. it works the fastest in directory browse mode, 
		so try that first. or you can go straight for the jugular
		and use the camera (works fine there too! not as fast
		though)

		ALSO: it currently requires "sed" to do the parsing of
		the tags (until i nail down a faster way internally)
		so you need that on your machine.

	* Configure scripts for building libraries and GTK+ application

		To build/install everything in /usr/local/ -- change to
		the gphoto source tree and type:
	
		./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
		make
		make install

		There is also "make clean", "make distclean", and 
		"make uninstall".

	* Command-line mode

		After building the gPhoto binary, type "gphoto -h" for
		command-line options. Here's the low-down:

	Usage: gphoto [-h] [-c] [-n] [-s # filename] [-t # filename]
	              [-d #] [-l filename]
		-h 			display this help screen
		-c                      display camera summary
		-n			display the # of pictures
		-s # filename		save image # as filename
		-t # filename		save thumbnail # as filename
		-d #			delete image # from camera
		-l filename		save live preview as filename

	Only catch is you MUST run gphoto in graphical
	mode to initially set the camera library before
	running in command-line mode!

	A simple script set up can automate a lot of things
	(batch saving, webcam, delete all pics, etc..), so
	please send scripts to gphoto-devel@gphoto.org when
	you have written some.

        ------------------------------------------------------------

	   Then type 'make' to build the camera model libraries, and
           the gphoto binary.

	3) Type 'make install' to install the camera libraries into
	   $PREFIX/lib/gphoto/ and the 'gphoto' binary in $PREFIX/bin/
