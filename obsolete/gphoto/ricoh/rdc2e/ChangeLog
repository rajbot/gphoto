0.1  First Alpha release 21 March 1999

0.2  11 May 1999

	Added in a 250ms delay between grabbing each picture. This seems to
	have stopped the intermittant error in reading some pictures at their
	start.

	Wrote my own stripped down "j6i2jpg" shell script that converts
	the *.j6i files to *.jpg files.  It's a little crude, but it works.

	Added a man page for "j6i2jpg".

0.2a 13 May 1999

	Added in two parameters (-q & -s) onto the j6i2jpg shell script and
	updated the associated man page.

	Dropped the retry timeout on sending a frame from 1 second to 1/2 sec.

	When a non 0x05 ACK is received, no error message is sent out unless
	in debug mode.

0.3 13 July 1999

	Added in -d, -i, -p & -s options to rdc2e program.

	Changed the old j6i2jpg to "j6iextract" script.

0.4 17 July 1999

	Added in support for specifing pictures to download on the
	command line after all options.

	Added in a '-v' option for version number. (WOW!)

0.5 10 August 1999


	Added in an option to rdc2e (-f) to start a command off when the
	downloads have been finished.

0.6 20 August 1999

	Added in the '-t' option to extract the date from a J6I file.

0.7 23 December 1999

	Thanks to Leon Brooks <leon@brooks.smileys.net> who guessed the
	right NAK (same as in RDC-300) by looking at the source in gPhoto
	we now have the ability to NAK invalid frames.  These could be either
	frames with invalid CRCs, or incorrect length.

	I also updated the WWW page to add in that if you get too many CRC
	errors, then install irqtune to clean this problem up.

	There is also a start to using rdc2e as a http server called from
	inetd.  It's really early, but uses TCP and is called with the
	"-q -w" options (in this order!) in inetd.conf.
