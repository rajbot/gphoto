Driver for Mustek MDC 800 cameras by Pedro Caria <pmiguel@maquina.com>.

01.10.1999:

ok, corrected the bug sent to [gphoto-devel] by Don Cockman
<don@hauraki.co.uk>

"Taking photos reports 'memory full' problem, but still works OK"

and wraped the debug messages around MUSTEK_DEBUG.


Status of 27.09.1999:

 Well the thing works, some minor timming problems wich no longer
influence the workings, have a configuration interface with the following
options:
      Image Quality
      Flash Mode (sorry still no red-eye, i'm loking for the proper
                   widget)
      Exposure settings
      Light Source
      Exposure Mode
      Auto-Off
      Menu Display (useless, I think)
      Storage-Source
      LCD ON/OFF

way to unlock them before exiting ?)
