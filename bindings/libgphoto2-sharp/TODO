==Things to rename==
CameraFilesystem.GetFS -> GetFs
USB->Usb
namespace LibGPhoto2 -> Gphoto2 (perhaps GPhoto2?)
Filesystem->FileSystem


==General Todo==
* More size checking:
** See if we can do comparisons with enum's?
** If not with compiled sources, perhaps by hand.
** amd64 uses double size longs, which means that these structs will NOT port.
** See if endianness matters with pulling in unmanaged structs?
* Integrate my testing libraries
* Perhaps split non-oo functions into a sub-namespace, and then expose a high-level object oriented namespace as GPhoto2?
* Speed test .NET 1.1 marshalling of structs versus 2.0 fixed array sizes; perhaps the runtime upgrade is worth the speed change?
* Finish working with CameraStorage*
** Return all storage objects rather than just the first.
** Handle setting where number of describeable storage devices != 1
