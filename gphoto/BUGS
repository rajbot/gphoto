ANONYMOUS CVS ACCESS
====================

For anonymous access to gPhoto in CVS you should follow these steps:

    1. First you need to setup the CVS environmental variables. 

       You might want to put this in your login script.
       export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome

    2. Then use CVS as normal like this:

          cvs login  (There is no password for the 'anonymous' user.)
          cvs -z3 checkout gphoto

   You can get individual library modules by:

         cvs -z3 checkout gphoto/sony
         cvs -z3 checkout gphoto/philips

STAY UP-TO-DATE

HOW TO SUBMIT BUGS
==================
If you have found a bug, please send it to <submit@bugs.gnome.org>:
Problem reports (with mail header) should look something like this:

        To: submit@bugs.gnome.org
        From: johndoe@gphoto.org
        Subject: invoking error

        Package: gphoto
        Version: CVS Mon Sep 27 20:32:29 CEST 1999  (or release)

        When I invoke `gphoto' without arguments from an ordinary
        shell prompt it prints `goodbye', instead of opening the 
        GTK+ window.

        Here is a transcript:

        $ gphoto
        goodbye
        $ /usr/local/bin/gphoto
        goodbye
        $

        I suggest that the foo() routine, in main.c, be corrected.

        (Consider submitting a patch ("diff -uN old/ new/").)

        I am using RedHat 6.0, Linux kernel version 2.2.5-15
        and GNU libc 2.1.1.
        -----------------------------------------------------

Please include in your report:

     * The exact and complete text of any error messages printed or
       logged. This is very important!
     * Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
     * A description of the incorrect behaviour: exactly what
       behaviour you were expecting, and what you observed. 
       A transcript of an example session is a good way of showing this.
     * A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
     * Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
       Include the complete text of its configuration files.

   Include any detail that seems relevant - you are in very little
   danger of making your report too long by including too much
   information. If they are small please include in your report any 
   files you were using to reproduce the problem (uuencoding them if 
   they may contain odd characters etc.).

   Of course, like any email, you should include a clear, descriptive
   Subject line in your main mail header. The subject you give will
   be used as the initial ticket title in the tracking system, so please
   try to make it informative.

Happy hunting!
