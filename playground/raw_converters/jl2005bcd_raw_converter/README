What is here?

This directory contains the source for a program for converting a raw file
from a JL2005B or JL2005C or JL2005D camera. If the camera provides thumbnails,
those are part of the raw file. If present, the thumnail will be detected and
will also be processed, saved as a separate file.

The program resulting from compilation will be called jl2005bcd_decompress.
To compile it, just do "make". To use it, either put it in some appropriate
place in your executable path, or into a directory which contains some raw
files from one of the supported cameras. Those raw files can be obtained by
running gphoto2 --get-all-raw-data. The syntax for using this executable is 
simply

jl2005bcd_decompress (name of raw file)

For example, if the raw file is named raw_jl_005.raw then you do 

jl2005bcd_decompress raw_jl_005.raw

The output file will be in the PPM format, which is an uncompressed bitmap
format. Its name will be derived from the name of the input file. Continuing
our example, it will be called jl_2005r.ppm, where the "r" in the name will
indicate that it was derived from a raw file using this program. If a
thumbnail is also present as part of the raw file, then the thumbnail will
also be saved as a file called jl2005r-thumb.ppm. If there is no thumbnail,
then no such file will be created. The presence or absence of a thumbnail
is dependent on the camera which produced the raw file. It seems that the
cameras which have a viewing screen on the rear will produce thumbnails, and
those which have no viewing screen will not.


PURPOSE

The first purpose for this program is experimentation with the processing of
raw data for the cameras for which it was designed. At the same time, it
clearly could also be used by anyone who has one of these cameras or raw
files from one of them and would prefer to  keep the data in the form of raw
camera output, on the grounds that it is smaller than a finished PPM image.


INSTALLATION

Just do "make" as stated above, and copy the executable to the place where you
want to copy it.
