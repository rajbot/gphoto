The installation procedure should be quite simple:

===============================
Step 0: Preparing configuration
===============================

If you got your copy of libgphoto2 packaged as a .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 tarball, 
SKIP THIS STEP. 

You must have libgphoto2 installed. If you have compiled libgphoto2, then 
you already have the required tools for compiling gtkam.

If you got libgphoto2 from CVS, then you will have to prepare for step 1,
the configuration of the sources.

For that, we supply you with a script called 'autogen.sh'. It calls
several tools in a certain sequence. For autogen.sh to work, you
require the following tools

	automake
	autoconf
	gettext
	libtool

in versions compatible to each other and to libgphoto2. Most
combinations on current GNU/Linux systems work, whereas BSD systems
tend to have some compatibility problems.

=============================
Step 1: Configure the sources
=============================

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	or any other options (try --help)

If you have difficulties building on FreeBSD, try --disable-nls
or install the gettext port (cd /usr/ports/devel/gettext && make install).

===========================
Step 2: Compile the program
===========================

To compile and install the program in one step, run

make install

This installs the software and documentation into the proper
directories on your system. If you want to use your system's
package system instead, follow a) for RPMs.

   a) make rpm

      If you're running a RPM based system (e.g. Redhat Linux or SuSE
      Linux), you can build RPM packages and install these. The
      packages will be located in packaging/rpm/RPMS/.

====================================================
Step 4: Installation is finished - now what do I do?
====================================================

At a command line, run 

gtkam

Enjoy!
