This code was imported from f-spot in mid-2006, and has been developed some
since then.  No API changes have been made, but some types have been updated
and code is a wee bit cleaner.  There are still some unimplemented features.
Most notably, the Object class has been reworked a bit so that it properly
disposes of unmanaged resources.

The source for f-spot can be found at:

http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/f-spot/libgphoto2-sharp

Many thanks to Larry Ewing and Ewen Cheslack-Postava for releasing this
code as LGPL so that it can operate with libgphoto2 and other code legally.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

   This is in alpha state, we still have a few things to figure
   out before we can call this interface stable.

TODO:

 * Implement Aaron Bockover's Shamrock m4 macros for mono searching

 * Define special binding macros like the camlib or iolib macros, perhaps
   even define a generic set of macros for all three.
