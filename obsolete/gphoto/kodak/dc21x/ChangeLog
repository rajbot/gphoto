12-31-1999	1.0	Initial release
01-03-2000	1.01	Added -D to delete all images from camera
01-04-2000	1.10	Complete protocol support.
			Added Zoom, Flash, Quality settings.
			Some delays added according to the protocol spec.
			Considering patching gphoto to use my nicely stable
			version :) More code clean-ups on the way, there are
			way too many if (success) checks, there is no possible
			way for some of the functions to fail.
