INSTALLATION:

	1) Untar/zip the archive by:

		tar zxvf gphoto-{version}.tgz

	   (but you knew that because you're reading this :-)

	2) Enter the GPhoto/src directory, and type 'make'.

	   This will build each camera model library, and 
           also build the gphoto binary.

	3) Type 'make install' to install the gphoto
           executable into /usr/local/bin/gphoto
