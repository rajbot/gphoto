Things to do for the DC240 Driver:
----------------------------------
   Error Handling:

      - Need to add recovery from a packet timeout during packet
        transfers.  The error function now knows what type of error
        occured (unknown, read, write, or timeout), but it doesn't
        do anything with the error.  The real question is "What should
        be done on timeout errors?"

      - Verify that packet checksum errors are correctly handled.
        Basically, someone needs to beat the hell out of the driver
        until you get a checksum error and make sure that checksum
        errors cause a packet retransmission.

      - Make the driver work correctly when gphoto is started with
        the camera turned off.  Currently for things to work right,
        the camera needs to be on when gphoto runs.

        There is some logic in kodak_dc240_helpers.c that attemts to
        reinitialize the camera (by asserting break and then trying
        to change the baud rate from 9600 to 115200) after an error,
        but I've never seen this work right.

        After the break, the command to change the baud rate is sent,
        but the camera goes bonkers after this.  By playing around with
        the IGNBRK flag, I made the determination that the camera seems
        to be asserting the break signal (or the PC thinks it is anyway).
        This could mean that we have a baud rate mismatch or we've done
        something to hose up the camera.

   Commands:

      - ...get_preview() needs to be implemented.

      - ...delete_picture() needs to be implemented.

      - ...get_status() could be changed to return more information.

      - ...configure() needs to be implemented.

Things to do for the generic Kodak support:
-------------------------------------------
   Nothing (yet).
