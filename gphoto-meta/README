About the mechanism:


1. run bootstrap.sh - if you downloaded gphoto-meta via CVS
===========================================================

Downloads sources for all subprojects from CVS into cvs-orig/. 
Then initializes the build system in a copy in cvs-src/.
Then configures the copy, builds distribution tarballs in dist/ and
installs into dist-root/.

Unfortunately, (due to usage of pkgconfig), we have to install
libgphoto2 before gtkam or gphoto2 will even configure.


2. run compileinstall.sh
========================

Unpacks the source packages from dist/ in src/ and installs them
to ${instroot} (default is inst-root/, but the dir can be given as
parameter to compileinstall.sh).


3. run "autogen.sh; configure; make dist"
=========================================

Creates a gphoto-meta-VERSION.tar.gz package containing all the
packages found in dist. This package can then be distributed and
used to build everything using compileinstall.sh.
