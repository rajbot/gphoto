This is a GNU Photo module for connecting to the Minolta Dimage V.

This code is distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2
or higher. The copyright on all code is currently held by myself, A Gustav
Hartmann (hartmann@upl.cs.wisc.edu) (c)1999.

There are (of course) some bugs left in the Minolta module; please read
the BUGS file.

Thanks to Minolta, who provided me with the protocol. While I did have to
sign an NDA to get it, I have a signed letter permitting me to "share this
information among the Linux community". Since the GNU GPL is all about
sharing, this seems acceptable. The single caveat from Minolta was that
they would provide no technical support, which meshes nicely with the
"no warranty implied or actual" clause associated with GNU GPL software.
