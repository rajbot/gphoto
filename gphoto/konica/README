Konica Q-M100 Digital Still Camera Utility for GNU/Linux

Copyright (C) 1999 Phill Hugo (GPL)

Heavily based on reverse engineering work by Jesper Skov and his Perl
script of similar functionality.

Konica are now developing a GPL driver which will form a semi-supported (ie, if
the email gets to the right person, they may help) reference driver for Unix
systems.

"make qm100" will make the CLI tool.
