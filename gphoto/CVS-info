gPhoto (GNU Photo) CVS Information

CVS is a powerful method of allowing many developers work on the same source
code. This is possible because each developer checks out a copy of the
current version of the source code. Then they each independently work on
their personal copy of the sources. When they have made changes, they commit
them back to the CVS respository. The CVS server takes care of things like
trying to merge their changes with those of others. When that doesn't work,
the developer is notified and they do a hand merge of the conflicts.

So that is how developers use CVS. To just try out the latest versions of
stuff, you don't have to usually worry about all that. You will just need to
understand how to check out packages. Understand, however, that you are
looking at the latest and greatest version, and usually it might not even
build, or it will core dump instantly. That is ok, as the people working on
it will fix those problems before a stable release is made, and annouced
publicly.

If you're not familiar with anonymous CVS, check out the cvs.ps file in your
distrib of CVS. If you have got a Redhat box, it is in /usr/doc/cvs-1.9 (or
another version number).

For anonymous access to gPhoto CVS you should follow these steps:

First you need to setup the CVS environmental variables. You might want to
put this in your login script.

     $ export CVSROOT=':pserver:anon@www.freespeech.com:/home/del/cvssrc'

Then use CVS as normal like this:

     $ cvs login
     The password for the 'anon' user is simply 'gphoto'.

     $ cvs -z3 checkout GPhoto
     Please use the -z3 option to minimize network bandwidth (-z9 eats
     too much CPU time - please don't use it).

Now you will want to go through and build and install gPhoto:

     $ cd GPhoto/src
     $ make && make install

After you have checked the code out, you can use:

     $ cvs -z3 update GPhoto

to update your personal copy of gPhoto to the latest version from the CVS
server and rebuild.
