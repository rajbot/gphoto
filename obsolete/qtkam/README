                   QtKam: A Qt/KDE interface to gPhoto2
                   ------------------------------------

            THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET ! DON'T USE IT !

What is QtKam ?
---------------
QtKam is a graphical frontend for gphoto2, using the Qt and KDE libraries.
For the moment, we aim at making the GUI functional for KDE. 
In the future, we're going to make a 'light' version of QtKam, for which
the KDE libraries won't be necessary.



Requirements
------------
* libgphoto2: the gphoto2 library, which can be obtained at 
              http://www.gphoto.net

* KDE libraries: can be found at http://www.kde.org

* Qt: the graphical toolkit on which the KDE libraries are built.
      When you have KDE, you should have the Qt libraries too. 
      More info on Qt can be found at http://www.trolltech.com/
               
* To be able to view thumbnails, you need either
    - JPEG support compiled in your Qt libs (compiled with the '-system-jpeg' 
      option)
    - JPEG support compiled in your KDE libs (doesn't seem to work yet)

* And of course: a C++ compiler.
