	Here are the major changes to 0.2:

        * updated the library interface
                added "initialize", "summary", and "description"
                only initialize and summary are used now. description
                will be used when the model/port selection dialog is
                updated, but it still needs to be defined. check
                out the photopc/olympus.c file for examples on using
                all 3 new functions.

        * updated the gphotorc file.
                remove your old one from your $HOME/.gphoto/ directory
                and then run gphoto and select your camera model.

        * added fuji and ricoh libraries, and camera entries.
                i don't own these cameras, so i don't know about their
                status, but i'm sure matt and cliff kicked some ass!

        * current camera library displayed on status bar
                i was getting confused when moving back and forth from
                directory browse mode to my olympus D220-L, so a text
                indicator is now down there... pretty handy.. :)

        * addition of directory browse mode.
                in the "select model/port", select "Browse directory"
                then, whenever you click on "get index", a file selector
                pops up to ask you which directory to open. all images
                in the directory are opened, and thumbnails are generated
                for all of them... it's really handy if all the images are
                already archived on your hard drive and you want to find
                one... also, this can be used in the HTML gallery!

        * HTML gallery
                the addition of this is a BIGGIE! this is really the first
                step in making gPhoto "more" than just a digicam utility.
                there is a "Default" theme included... to install it,
                you MUST do a "make install" to copy all files to the
                correct location (/usr/share/gphoto/gallery/) after   
                you "make" the package

                Using it:
                        * get the index first
                        * select the images to include in the gallery.
                        * go to "plugins->HTML Gallery"   
                        * type in a name for the Gallery
                        * click on "Default" for the theme
                        * "Change" the output directory to where you want
                                it.
                        * click on "create"

                it will go through the motions, and tell you when it's
                done. it works the fastest in directory browse mode,
                so try that first. or you can go straight for the jugular
                and use the camera (works fine there too! not as fast
                though)

                ALSO: it currently requires "sed" to do the parsing of
                the tags (until i nail down a faster way internally)
                so you need that on your machine.

        * Makefile in root source tree
                people don't need to change to the src directory anymore.
                just change to the root source tree (gphoto-0.2-1) and
                type "make" then "make install".. there is also
                "make clean", and "make uninstall"

        * Command-line mode
                after building the gPhoto binary, type "gphoto -h" for
                command-line options. here's the low-down:

	GNU Photo v.0.2
	Usage: gphoto [-h] [-n] [-s # filename] [-t # filename]
	              [-d #] [-l filename] 
	        -n                      display the # of pictures
	        -s # filename           save image # as filename
	        -t # filename           save thumbnail # as filename
	        -d #                    delete image # from camera
	        -l filename             save live preview as filename
	        -h                      display this help screen

                only catch is you MUST run gphoto in graphical
                mode to initially set the camera library before
                running in command-line mode!

                a simple script set up can automate a lot of things
                (batch saving, webcam, delete all pics, etc..)
                so maybe there should be some scripts written to
                provide these things for users to download? :)
