      Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distributing, and Modifying
      </emphasis></para>

      <para>
      Items other than copying, distributing, and modifying the 
      Content with which this license was distributed (such as using, 
      etc.) are outside the scope of this license.
      </para>

      <para>
      1. You may copy and distribute exact replicas of the OpenContent (OC)
      as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and 
      appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and 
      disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this 
      License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
      recipients of the OC a copy of this License along with the OC. You may 
      at your option charge a fee for the media and/or handling involved in 
      creating a unique copy of the OC for use offline, you may at your option
      offer instructional support for the OC in exchange for a fee, or you may
      at your option offer warranty in exchange for a fee. You may not charge
      a fee for the OC itself. You may not charge a fee for the sole
      service 
      of providing access to and/or use of the OC via a network (e.g. the 
      Internet), whether it be via the world wide web, FTP, or any other 
      method.
      </para>

      <para>
      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the OpenContent or any portion 
      of it, thus forming works based on the Content, and distribute 
      such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
      that you also meet all of these conditions: 
      </para>
   
      <para>
      a) You must cause the modified content to carry prominent
      notices  stating that you changed it, the exact nature and
      content of the changes, and the date of any change. 
      </para>

      <para>
      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
      or in part contains or is derived from the OC or any part thereof, to be
      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
      this License, unless otherwise permitted under applicable Fair Use law.
      </para>

      <para>
      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the OC, and can 
      be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, 
      then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when 
      you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same 
      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the OC, the 
      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
      each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Exceptions are made to
      this requirement to release modified works free of charge under this 
      license only in compliance with Fair Use law where applicable.
      </para>

      <para>
      3. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
      signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, 
      distribute or modify the OC. These actions are prohibited by law if you 
      do not accept this License. Therefore, by distributing or translating 
      the OC, or by deriving works herefrom, you indicate your acceptance of 
      this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
      distributing or translating the OC. 
      </para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>NO WARRANTY</title>
      <para>
      4. BECAUSE THE OPENCONTENT (OC) IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS
      NO WARRANTY FOR THE OC, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
      WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
      PARTIES PROVIDE THE OC "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
      EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
      THE ENTIRE RISK OF USE OF THE OC IS WITH YOU.
      SHOULD THE OC PROVE FAULTY, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE UNACCEPTABLE 
      YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 
      </para>

      <para>
      5. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING 
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MIRROR AND/OR
      REDISTRIBUTE THE OC AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
      INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
      ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OC, EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
      OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    <title>Introducing digital imaging</title>
    <para>With traditional photography you have to wait for Polaroids, then
    you have to wait for the film to be developed, then you have to wait for 
    the color separations, not to mention all of the messengers between
    all those stops. That's a lot of time and money being spent.</para>

    <para>Digital image devices are the newest got-to-have-it peripheral 
    for your computer. They supply instant gratification in the form of
    a digital image you can immediately pop into a document, print, or
    send off as e-mail to your friend. For fun, ease of use, and
    immediate impact, digital photo devices can't be beat. But they are not
    all created equal.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
    <title>Film Scanners</title>
    <para>Film scanners can read in your 35mm slides and negatives.
    This is especially helpful if you no longer have the prints available
    for your paper scanner.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
    <title>Paper Scanners</title>
    <para>Paper scanners allow you to create a digital image from documents,
    hard-copy photos, and other media. There exists 3D scanners as well,
    which have a depth-of-field perception to create an image on your
    computer with apparent depth.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
    <title>Digital Cameras</title>

    <para>Digital cameras have the balance of quality, features, and 
    price that appeals to users looking for a fast and convenient
    way to get images into their PC. You can spend a lot more -- or
    a lot less -- for one than the $400 to $1000 these cost, but you 
    won't like the quality at the low end or the prices at the high end. 
    With digital cameras, the best place to be is in the middle.</para>

    <para>No other image-capture option for your computer matches the fun, 
    immediacy, and convenience of a digital camera. Unlike with a 
    scanner, you don't need an already-existing image: A digital 
    camera lets you capture what you see. And unlike film-to-disk 
    services, a digital camera is immediate: You don't have to wait 
    hours or days before you can use an image on your computer.</para>
  
    <para>Operating a digital camera is also inexpensive, because the only 
    recurring cost is batteries. The camera's storage is reusable once you
    download a batch of images. And since you don't have to pay for film 
    processing, you can go wild.</para>
  
    <para>Don't expect digital photo technology to replace film cameras yet.
    They're still years away from challenging regular cameras in image 
    quality and even in features for the price. Pictures from film
    cameras have resolutions of many thousands of dots per inch; most
    digital cameras have resolutions under 100 dpi. If your
    application requires the highest  possible image quality, your
    best bet is to use a film camera and then scan the processed
    photo.  You'll be better off using digital cameras for screen-oriented 
    applications such as e-mail attachments and for non-professional 
    printing applications.</para>

    <para>There are dramatic differences among digital cameras.</para>

    <para>Although the image quality produced by digital still cameras
    still lags behind 35mm film, the latest crop of PC-ready cameras
    moves a lot closer to the mark--thanks to megapixel resolutions
    and a raft of nifty new features that make digital picture-taking
    easier than ever.</para>

    <para>Because every photographer is different, only you can decide
    which digital camera is the perfect one for you. Each cameras offer 
    distinct features and capabilities, and you will need to assess each 
    one in terms of your specific skills and intended use. But you really 
    can't lose. Most cameras provide good image quality in a wide variety 
    of conditions.</para>

    <para>Film-less photography also offers many other advantages. Most
    digital cameras store pictures on tiny removable memory cards,
    eliminating the expense associated with buying and processing
    film. You can balance file size against image quality by setting
    the resolution and compression level of each picture, and many
    digital cameras provide both a conventional glass view-finder
    and an LCD that lets you compose photographs, review stored
    pictures, and use on-screen menus to adjust settings. Photos
    appear on the screen only a few seconds after you shoot them,
    and if you're unhappy with what you see, they can be easily
    deleted. Stored photographs are normally downloaded through a
    serial port. Most vendors sell adapters that let you insert
    memory cards into a floppy drive or PC Card slot.</para>
    
    <para>If you want to play the photos back right away as a slide show
    on your TV, then a camera with a video-out port is essential.  
    Also, if you need to take extreme close-ups, get a camera with
    a macro lens; automatic flash and exposure control are
    standard on digital cameras, but special items such as zoom
    lenses are not. You should also make sure you're comfortable
    with the camera's weight and the placement of its buttons.</para>
    
    <para>Inexpensive Megapixel Digital Cameras range (in June '99,
    when this was written) in price from $350 to $599, and you 
    can get at least 4MB of storage, a LCD screen, built-in flash, 
    and 1,152x864 resolution from Eastman Kodak Co. and Konica, who 
    provide protocol specifications to free software developers.</para>

    <para>Many of the features--such as autofocusing lenses, 
    ----self-timers, and special red-eye-reducing flash modes--will 
    seem familiar to anyone who owns a late-model film camera. Some 
    new digital models even emulate the functions of zoom lenses, 
    motorized power winders, and panoramic cameras.</para>

    <para>Comparing digital cameras is no more complicated than 
    comparing film cameras once you understand what the possible
    features are. Here's a glossary of features that you may find.
    </para>

      <sect2>
      <title>35mm Lens Equivalent</title>
      <para>Digital Cameras utilize different lens lengths than the
      traditional 35mm cameras. In order to make any useful comparison,
      manufacturers offer an equivalent lens length to 35mm cameras.
      There are three basic types of lenses that come on Digital Cameras:
      Wide Angle, Normal and Telephoto. Wide Angle lenses have lengths
      which generally range from 25-40mm. Normal lenses have lengths
      ranging from 45-55mm. Normal lenses are closest to those in our own
      eyes. Telephoto lenses begin roughly at 100mm and continue much
      higher. In rare cases, equivalent lens lengths were unattainable,
      and actual lens lengths are given instead.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Aperture</title>
      <para>The Aperture is the lens opening that allows light to hit the
      image sensor inside the Digital Camera. Apertures are measured as
      f-stops (F). The f-stop is inversely related to the size of the
      lens opening; the larger the f-stop the smaller the opening.
      Digital Cameras in this search have either Fixed Apertures, which
      do not allow you to make adjustments or Aperture Ranges which do
      allow you to make adjustments. Many Digital Cameras do have
      different Fixed Apertures to choose form.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Audio Recording</title>
      <para>This feature allows you to record sound bites with the image, to
      annotate each shot.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>You can capture your thoughts at the exact moment
      you take a photograph.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Battery Type</title>
      <para>This specifies the type of batteries that come with the Digital
      Camera. Cameras that are Tethered are powered directly from the
      computer.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Color Depth</title>
      <para>Digital Cameras create colors using red, green and blue. A
      camera with 24-bit color will have 8 bits per channel. This will
      produce 256 different shades per channel. The end result is a
      camera capable of reproducing millions of different colors.
      Greyscale refers to black and white images.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Continuous Shooting</title>
      <para>This feature allows the camera to take multiple shots in a row.
      Most cameras take at least one frame per second.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>Continuous Shooting helps to capture high speed
      sequences, such as a golf swing, and can also act as motion
      video.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Dimensions (HxWxD)</title>
      <para>The dimensions of the Digital Camera, measured in inches (Height
      x Width x Depth).</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Flash</title>
      <para>A device that produces a burst of light for your picture. There
      are several different options that may come with the flash. Some
      cameras have automatic flash, which means that the camera decides
      when more light is needed for the picture and then fires the flash
      automatically. Other options include manual over ride, always on,
      always off and red eye reduction. Red Eye Reduction is helpful when
      taking pictures of people. With red eye reduction, all your friends
      and relatives won't appear to be vampires in every shot.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Focus</title>
      <para>This feature allows you to adjust the lens of the camera to
      produce the sharpest image possible. Digital Cameras have two
      different kinds of focusing, Fixed Focus and Auto Focus. Fixed
      Focus comes set by the manufacturer and you cannot make any
      adjustments. In some cameras there are multiple Fixed Focus
      settings that you may select. Cameras with Auto Focus will actually
      make all the adjustments necessary to produce the sharpest image
      for you. All you have to do is point and let the camera do the
      work.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Image Capacity</title>
      <para>The number of images that the Digital Camera can store at its
      minimum resolution or highest compression mode. This number usually
      relates to lower quality images. Note: This number reflects
      image capacity with standard memory only. Most manufacturers offer
      additional memory which can greatly increase storage
      capacity.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>The more images a camera can hold without additional
      memory the better.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Image Capacity at Max Res.</title>
      <para>This notes the number of images the Digital Camera can store at
      its highest resolution or lowest compression mode. Note: This
      number usually relates to high quality images.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Interface</title>
      <para>This is the method in which your Digital Camera and Computer
      communicate. A Serial or Parallel interface connects with a port in
      the back of your desktop. PCMCIA interfaces plug directly into
      laptops. Other methods of communication between computer and
      Digital Camera include Infrared (wireless), SCSI, and even 3.5-inch
      Floppy Disks.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>ISO Equivalent</title>
      <para>Traditional 35mm cameras use the International Standards
      Organization (ISO) to determine film speed.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>The higher the ISO number, the less light needed for
      the picture. Digital Cameras do not use traditional film, so the
      industry uses an equivalency rating. This rating specifies the
      Digital Camera's sensitivity to lighting. For example, ISO 100
      could be used for sunny outside shots, while ISO 800 could take
      candlelight stills with no flash.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>
      
      <sect2>
      <title>LCD Size (in)</title>
      <para>The size of the LCD viewfinder screen measured
      diagonally in inches.</para>
      </sect2>
      
      <sect2>
      <title>Macro</title>
      <para>A lens that can take close-up shots, approximately one foot or
      closer.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>Camera has the ability to take extremely close-up
      shots.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Max. Resolution</title>
      <para>Each digital image is comprised of thousands of tiny dots called
      pixels. Resolution equals the number of horizontal pixels
      multiplied by the number of vertical pixels. The more pixels per
      image, the better the clarity of the picture.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>The higher the Max Resolution, the better the
      picture. High resolution doesn't come cheap and requires much more
      memory per picture.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>On Camera Editing</title>
      <para>This feature allows you to manipulate the amount of photos on
      the cameras has stored in its memory.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>This will allow you to delete unwanted pictures from
      the camera, freeing up storage space. If you don't like a shot,
      this feature lets you to immediately delete it rather than waiting
      to download the images to the computer. Cameras with LCD screens
      may offer other options. Some cameras can show one to 12 pictures
      simultaneously on the screen and allow you to edit each shot
      individually or all at once.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Other Resolution Modes</title>
      <para>Optional settings to vary the quality of image stored in the
      camera's memory.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>Sometimes expressed in the manufacturer's verbal
      interpretation (Good, Better, Best), rather than in pixels.
      Resolution equals the number of horizontal pixels multiplied by the
      number of vertical pixels. The more pixels per image the better the
      clarity of the picture. High-resolution images take up more of the
      camera's memory. Cameras that allow you to switch resolutions give
      you the option of saving valuable storage space at the expense of
      image quality.</emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis>Compression reduces the size of the data, allowing for
      additional pictures to be stored in the camera's memory. Compressed
      data has to be expanded before use, which causes the images to lose
      some of their clarity, in essence reducing the resolution. Some
      photo software, like gPhoto, have the ability to increase the 
      resolution after the image has been downloaded into the
      computer.</emphasis></para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Red Eye Reduction</title>
      <para><!-- No glossary entry for this item. --></para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>Red eye reduction is helpful when taking pictures of
      people. With red eye reduction, all your friends and relatives

      <title>Shutter Speed</title>
      <para>The camera's shutter is a device which opens and closes,

      <title>Storage Type</title>
      <para>There are two types of storage for Digital Cameras, internal and
      removable. Internal storage comes inside the camera, and usually
      cannot be altered. In a few cases, manufacturers will put
      additional memory inside the camera, at additional costs. Once the
      internal memory is full, download the images to the computer and
      start again. Some cameras have On Camera Editing features which
      allow you to preview and delete at the camera. This can free up
      internal storage space without having to download.</para>
      <para><emphasis>Removable Storage</emphasis> is Digital Camera memory that can be
      replaced. As soon as one card is full, pull it out, insert another
      and keep shooting. There are several types of removable storage
      medium with varying capacity. CompactFlash, SmartMedia (SSFDC), and
      Miniature Cards are the three most common types of removable
      storage. Each come in a variety of densities, anywhere from 2MB to
      64MB and beyond. Another type of removable storage is Type II or
      III PCMCIA cards which can insert directly into laptop computers.
      Some manufacturers use their own proprietary removable storage
      medium, while others can use every day 3.5-inch floppy disks. There
      is no set standard in the industry at this time.</para>
      <para>Digital Cameras that are <emphasis>Tethered</emphasis> to the
      computer have no storage capacity of their own. Images are 
      downloaded directly to the computer's hard drive or floppy
      disk.  Capacity is therefore dependent on the computer's disk 
      space.  Those cameras are usually referred to as "webcams".</para>

      <title>Video Out</title>
      <para>The Video Out feature allows you to plug the Digital Camera
      directly into a TV or VCR.</para>

      <title>Viewfinder</title>
      <para>The device used to preview your image before taking the picture.
      Digital Cameras have two kinds of viewfinders, optical and LCD.
      Optical viewfinders require you to put the camera up to your eye to
      see what you are shooting at. LCDs (Liquid Crystal Display) are
      flat screens that display images on a 1-3 inch screen. LCDs can
      also display camera functions and battery life. Batteries tend to
      last significantly less when using the LCD screen. Some cameras
      have both optical viewfinders and LCDs.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>Allows you to preview what your picture will look
      like before you waste a picture.</emphasis></para>

      <title>Zoom</title>
      <para>Lenses that can change Focal Lengths are Zoom Lenses. A camera's
      Focal Length is the distance at which the lens brings light into
      focus.</para>
      <para>Benefit: <emphasis>A large Focal Length will make distant
      subjects appear closer.</emphasis></para>

  <title>Software for Digital Photo Devices</title>

  <para>
  Unfortunately, many hardware equipment manufacturers refuse to share
  open specifications with potential customers and several millions of
  users who run free operating systems.</para>

  <para>This is a big obstacle to development of free photo
  applications,
  and it blocks free software developers from writing free programs 
  in the future, that supports the same features as the proprietary 
  camera programs for Windows or MacOS that usually are shipped with 
  the camera.   It renders the camera quite useless, if you don't run 
  one of those proprietary operating systems.
  </para>

  <para>Refusing to share free and open camera specifications with
  free software developers is equal to methods Microsoft has said
  (in the <ulink
  url="http://www.opensource.org/halloween/">"Halloween 
  documents"</ulink>) it will use to obstruct free software.</para>

  <para>
  We encourage buyers to boycott the manufacturers with closed-spec
  policies, and companies in the industry to release documentation
  of interfaces between hardware, communications protocols, and new
  file formats to free software developers, who will write drivers.
  </para>

  <para>  
  If your company cannot publish the details, because of some other 
  organization's policy, you should explain briefly why you will 
  continue to market and sell a secret interface, so we can warn 
  other free software users, so they can buy a supported product.
