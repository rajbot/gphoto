This is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate digital
still cameras based on Fujitsu chipset and Sierra Imaging firmware.  The
program is known to work with Agfa, Epson, Olympus Sanyo and Nikon (at
least CoolPix 900) cameras.

The cameras typically come with software for Windows and for Mac, and no
description of the protocol.  With this tool, they are managable from a
UNIX box.  Bruce D. Lightner <lightner@metaflow.com> has added support
for Win32 and DOS platforms.  Note that the program does not have any
GUI, it is plain command-line even on Windows.

I tried it under Linux/x86, FreeBSD and Solaris 2.5.1/SPARC, and it
should be straightforward for other UNIX systems.  Read the top of
Makefile and edit OPTS according to your system.  For Windows and DOS,
use Makefile.win and Makefile.dos respectively; no modification should
be needed.

Generally, UNIX system requirements are:
- ANSI C compiler
- select() system call
- POSIX termios
- presence of a 16bit integer type
- serial port (with or without `modem control').

First of all, edit the top portion of Makefile to suit your system.

Typing `make' will result in building the library and executables in the
current directory.  `make install' will install the executables and
manual pages.  `make install.lib' will install the library and the .h
file.

The executable parameters are rather clear (hopefully).  Running
`photopc -h | more' will print the list of options and commands.  If you
are going to use the library for your own application and need the docs,
tell me and I will write them.

Included file `protocol.htm' contains description of the protocol used
by the camera.

`usage.htm' is a "casual" user's guide, full description is in the man
pages.

If you run the program on a DOS box, you may want a JPEG viewer; I've
been told that a good free viewer `LXPIC' can be found at
http://home.t-online.de/home/stefan.peichl.

Many commands may not be implemented, esp. those specific for newer
models.  If you know how to do things that the program currently cannot
do, please let me know.

I can be contacted at <crosser@average.org>, fresh version of this tool
(if any) is at ftp://ftp.average.org/pub/photopc/, related information
is at http://www.average.org/digicam/.  The same code accompanied by
Win32 and DOS executables and archived in .zip format can be found at
http://www.metaflow.com/lightner/bruce/photopc/

Thanks to Jeff Tranter for contributing a man page and a few bugfixes,
Bruce Lightner for Windows and DOS support, Thierry Bousch for many
details of the protocol and advice, and other people who helped me to
track down problems and learn more about the protocol.
