This folder contains some proofs of concepts showing dynamic loading
working.

Its easy isn't it ;)

Math shows the "man dlopen" example code

Unified is the called back concept in one file

Dynamic is the called back concept called in and out of a library in two
file, linked at compile time

Runtime is the called back concept called in and out of a dynamically
loaded file at runtime.

The Runtime concepts show enough to provide dynamic loading of camera
libraries.
