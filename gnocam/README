GNOCAM
------

GnoCam was born because I felt a need for a small but powerful frontend to 
gphoto2 for the GNOME desktop.

GnoCam actually is a quick hack. I borrowed code from or got inspired by
gtCam and several GNOME applications like evolution, EOG, etc. See TODO for 
a list of things that remain to be done.

GnoCam requires at least the following libraries. Please get the latest 
version from http://www.gnome.org. 
 * gnome-libs
 * bonobo
 * libglade
 * gnome-vfs
 * gconf
 * xml-i18n-tools
If you experience compilation errors, don't hesitate to report them.
