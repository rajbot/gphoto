I started working on the protocol for Toshiba's PDR M1

PROBLEMS

	- The camera seems to expect some kind of handshaking/flow-control
	  behaviour from the computers side. If you are familiar with
          Comlite (Windows Serial Line Sniffer) please have a look at
          the file ./doc/toshiba.rtb :
	  the flags(?) DDCD, DCTS have to go high, that the camera starts
	  sending zeros, which then is acknowledged by the computer with
	  0x05. (see session.log)
	- the CRC used at the end of packets is magic. Probably saving
          some CRC'd packets plus their CRC and feeding this into a CRC
	  analyzer (that just tries all polynoms) might work.
