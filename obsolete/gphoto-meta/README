What can you do with gphoto-meta?
========================================================================


1. run bootstrap.sh - if you downloaded gphoto-meta via CVS
===========================================================

If you don't have current autoconf, automake, gettext and libtool
installed (i.e. you run into trouble), run bootstrap.sh with the 
"--tools" parameter and it will download, build and locally install
all these tools in a working version.

bootstrap.sh downloads sources for all subprojects from CVS into 
cvs-orig/ - if this hasn't already been done before. If you already
have CVS sources in cvs-orig, you can have bootstrap.sh update to
current CVS by running it with the --update parameter.

Then bootstrap.sh initializes the build system in a copy in cvs-src/.

It configures the copy, builds distribution tarballs in 
dist-files/ and installs into dist-root/ if necessary.
Unfortunately, (due to usage of pkgconfig), we have to install
libgphoto2 before gtkam or gphoto2 will even configure.


2. run compileinstall.sh
========================

Unpacks the source packages from dist/ in src/ and installs them
to ${instroot} (default is inst-root/, but the dir can be given as
parameter to compileinstall.sh):

   compileinstall /absolute/path


3. run "autogen.sh; configure; make dist"
=========================================

Creates a gphoto-meta-VERSION.tar.gz package containing all the
packages found in dist. This package can then be distributed and
used to build everything using compileinstall.sh.


========================================================================
How does it work?
========================================================================

The file "cvs-module-list" contains a list of CVS modules to download
and compile. Every line describes a CVS module with its location,
name, the revision to download and some options describing how to
process it.

You may want to change the sequence of the modules in cvs-module-list
or remove some modules altogether. However, keep in mind the following
dependency graph.

E.g., if you want to use gtkam with a USB camera, you need at least
libusb, libgphoto2 and gtkam in cvs-module-list, probably also
libexif. Also, you must have gtk+-2.0 with the development files
installed.

Module dependency graph:

                 libusb
                    |
                   [2]
                    V
     gphoto2 <-- libgphoto2 --> gtkam
        ^           ^             ^
        |           |             |
(popt)--+          [1]            +------------+------- (gtk+-2.0)
        |           |             |            |
        V           |             V            V
       exif <-- libexif --> libexif-gtk --> gexif
        ^
        |
     libmnote

Footnotes:
  [1] - libexif is recommended for cameras using EXIF JPEG images
        (almost all cameras do that)
  [2] - libusb is required if libgphoto2 must be able to use 
        USB cameras

The two modules popt and gtk+-2.0 are optional and not contained in
this package, but required for some modules:

- all graphical applications (gtkam, gexif) require gtk+-2.0
- the command line applications (gphoto2, exif) require popt


========================================================================
What is still missing?
========================================================================

- better dependency tracking in compileinstall.sh
- install required tools and libs in compileinstall.sh
