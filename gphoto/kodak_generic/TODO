Things to do for the DC240 Driver:
----------------------------------
   - Need to add recovery from a packet timeout during data transfers.
     The problem is that the error function doesn't know what type of
     error occured.  This information needs to be passed into the error
     handler function so that it can decide to retry the packet in the
     event of a timeout.

   - There is a nasty problem with reading the directory when the directory
     has more entries than will fit into a single packet.  When this
     happens, the driver causes a SEGV when reading the second packet.
     The strange thing is that the correct amount of space was allocated
     by malloc at the start of the operation, but by the time that the
     next packet arrives, everything goes haywire.

Things to do for the generic Kodak support:
