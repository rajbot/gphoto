gPhoto 0.1-DR User's Manual
---------------------------

gPhoto was designed to be as intuitive as possible. The toolbar provides
shortcuts to many of the features listed below.

Getting Thumbnails/Previews
---------------------------
	In the "Camera" menu, select "Get Index"

Downloading Images
------------------
	After getting the index, select the images you want to download
	by clicking on them (border will turn red). Then, in the
	"Camera" menu, select "Get Selected Images".

Manipulating Images
-------------------
	After downloading an image, view it by clicking on its tab.
	Then, click the desired manipulation. Available are
	rotate clockwise, rotate counter-clockwise, flip horizontal,
	flip vertical, and resize.

	* For intensive image manipulation, fire up the GIMP!

Send to the GIMP
----------------
	Not currently supported.

Saving Images
-------------
	Click on the tab of the image you want to save, and select
	"Save" from the "File" menu. Select the directory you want
	to save the image in, and type in a name for the image.
	The extension will determine which format the image is saved
	in.

	Example: image.jpg

	Supported: jpg gif png tif (and others...)
	(whatever is supported by your installation of imlib)

Batch Saving
------------

	Select "Batch Save" from the "File" menu. Then, select the
	directory that will store all the images and click "OK".

	* Currently, gPhoto only supports saving ALL images and/or
	  thumbnails.

	* Pictures are all stored as JPEG images by default.

Printing Images
---------------
	Click on the tab of the image you want to print, and select
	"Print" from the "File" menu.
	Note: it might take a minute for the image to print, depending
	on how fast the image is spooled.

Closing Downloaded Images
-------------------------
	Click on the tab of the image you want to close, and select
	"Close" from the "File" menu.

Deleting Images from the Camera
-------------------------------
	In the image index, select the images you wish to remove from
	the camera by clicking on the thumnail (border will turn red).
	Then, from the "Camera" menu, select "Delete Selected Images".
	A confirmation will appear. Click "yes" or "no".

Selecting the Serial Port
-------------------------
	Select "Select Port" from the "Camera" menu.

Configuring the Camera
----------------------
	Select "Configure" from the "Camera" menu.

Live preview plugin
-------------------
        Select "Live cam" from the "Plugins" menu.
	Click on "Take picture" to update preview.

Command line mode
-----------------
	The command-line mode must be specified at run time
        with the "-c" parameter.

	$ gphoto -c filename
	where "filename" is the path and image name (+ extension)
	to save a preview snapshot.

	Example:
	$ gphoto -c /home/httpd/html/livepic.jpg

	The command line mode is handy, if you want to set up a web
	camera, and use gphoto in a script, e.g. with Perl/PHP. :-)
					  
Tips and Tricks
---------------
	* Make sure your camera is connected and turned ON. :-)
	* If something fails (getting index, configuring camera, ...)
	  try again. There are some things that need to be done still
	  to make sure the camera does what you want it to do.
	* Have fun, and give us feedback if your camera fail or succeed
          to <gphoto-devel@lists.styx.net>.  Thanks for using gPhoto!
