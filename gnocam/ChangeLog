	* gnome-vfs-module/camera-method.c: Work on the bonoboized version.
	Remove comments before "#define USE_BONOBO" if you'd like to check
	it out.
	* configure.in: Don't use AM_PATH_GCONF - there seem to be systems 
	with GConf out there that don't have this macro.

	* bonobo-storage-module/bonobo-storage-camera.c: 
	'mode' is for permissions, 'flags' are for example Bonobo_Storage_READ. 
	Not the other way round.
	* bonobo-moniker: For now, just open with READ (not WRITE). Added 
	FIXME about this.

2001-05-01	Lutz Müller  <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* libgnocam/gphoto-extensions.c: Use gnome_vfs_mime_type_from_name 
	when the camera library doesn't set the mime type.

	Regarding a suggestion Fabrice Bellet made:

	* libgnocam/gphoto-extensions.c: Keep references to all cameras in
	a hash table in order to reduce redundancy. Speeds up the 
	gnome-vfs-module enormously.

2001-04-21	Lutz Müller  <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* gnome-vfs-module/*: More debugging stuff. Files are now local because
	we don't know if the camera is based on the "Directory Browse". 

2001-04-21	Lutz Müller  <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* gnome-vfs-module/*: Tried to get it working with the konica driver.
	Didn't succeed...

2001-04-20	Lutz Müller  <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* gnome-vfs-module/*: 
	* libgnocam/*: Preliminary gp_camera_file_info_* support.

2001-04-20	Lutz Müller  <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* configure.in:
	* src/gnocam_storage_view.c: Bring API in sync with gal-0.7.99.0

2001-04-14	Lutz Mueller  <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* configure.in: Applied patch from Martin Pool <mbp@samba.org> which
	fixes a typo in configure.in.
