     gPhoto is IN DEVELOPMENT, so please [1]submit bugs and comments to
                    [2]gphoto-devel@gphoto.org. Thanks!

   Camera support and open specifications
   
   Kodak and Minolta both provide specifications openly for their cameras
   meaning drivers for them can be written openly.
   
   Konica has recently started work on a GPL application for *BSD and
   GNU/Linux which Phill Hugo [3]<phill@gnu.org> will incorporate into
   gPhoto extending the current Konica driver.
   
   It is always a great help for potential camera customers to pressure
   companies into support our work BEFORE you give them your money.
   
   Many companies simply don't have time to look at the issues involved
   unless there is an financial incentive to do so. The more open we can
   make them, the better gPhoto can be and the more enjoyment you'll get
   from your camera.
   
   Phill has added the file ``CONTACTS'' in CVS, that contains a list of
   company members who you can write to asking for GPL drivers or open
   specifications. There is also a sample letter in ``LETTER''.

   gPhoto in GNOME CVS
   
   Scott Fritzinger [4]<scottf@scs.unr.edu> has imported the most recent
   source tree into GNOME CVS.
   
   For anonymous access to gPhoto in GNOME CVS you should follow these
   steps:
    1. First you need to setup the CVS environmental variables. You might
       want to put this in your login script.
       export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome
    2. Then use CVS as normal like this:
          + cvs login
            There is no password for the 'anonymous' user.
          + cvs -z3 checkout gphoto
            Please use the -z3 option to minimize network bandwidth (-z9
            eats too much CPU time - please don't use it).
       
   You can get individual library modules by:
     * cvs -z3 checkout gphoto/sony
     * cvs -z3 checkout gphoto/philips
       
   Daily snapshots and patches will be available from anonymous FTP
   [5]ftp://ftp.jimpick.com/pub/gnome/snap/gphoto/ tomorrow.
   
   [6]bonsai is a tool that lets you perform queries on [7]gphoto files
   in the CVS.
   
   [8]GNOME Cross-Reference is a cross referenced display of the GNOME
   source code. The sources displayed are those that are currently
   checked in to the mainline of the GNOME project CVS server; these
   pages are updated many times a day, so they should be pretty close to
   the latest-and-greatest.
   
   Visit the [9]www.gnome.org web for further information about the GNOME
   project.

   gPhoto CVS shut down - merging with GNOME CVS
   
   Miguel de Icaza [10]<miguel@gnu.org>, coordinator of the [11]GNOME
   project and [12]Gnumeric author, has offered us CVS server-space:

Please guys, all of those in the gPhoto team that want access to the
GNOME CVS send your information to Ole, and have him mail me all of
the details in a single chunk.

The information I need is:

    Your full name.
    Your desired login name.
    Your crypted password.

Do not use a crypted password that is used for your regular machine
login.

Best wishes,
Miguel.

   [17]Scott Fritzinger [18]<scottf@scs.unr.edu>, the main author of
   gPhoto, imports the current tree into GNOME CVS as soon he get his
   account.

   Support for Kodak DC240
   
   Randy D. Scott [19]<scottr@wwa.com> writes
   
     Just a few hours ago, I finished my initial coding for support of
     the Kodak DC240 camera. It's got a few problems still, but it was
     good enough for me to get a batch of pictures off of it.
     
     In fact, since I don't run Windows, today was the first time that
     I've been able to see the pictures that I've taken. Digital cameras
     are cool...
     
     Anyway, I'll finish cleaning it up a little in the next few days
     and then make it available for others to play with (assuming that
     anyone actually has one of these)
     
     Also, I'd like to discuss combining all of the Kodak drivers for
     those cameras that require approximately the same protocol (which
     would be the DC20, DC25, DC200, DC210, and DC240, minimally, I
     think). I'm thinking that it would be possible to "auto-detect" the
     type of Kodak camera connect and have the driver communicate
     appropriately.
     
   We have set up a special [20]mailinglist for Kodak library related
   discussions called [21]gphoto-kodak.
   
   Future digital camera buyers who want to be updated on the gPhoto
   effort, could join the general [22]gphoto list, for announcements.
   
   [23]Eastman Kodak, Inc. is one of few digital camera companies that
   [24]support the developers in this project with open camera
   specifications.

   Images from Open Networks '99
   
   The leader of the [25]KDE project, Kalle Dalheimer, as well as the
   leader of the [26]GNOME project, Miguel de Icaza, were both speakers
   at the [27]Open Networks '99 show in Copenhagen, Denmark, a three day
   conference on April 30th, May 1st and 2nd 1999.
   
   Ole has posted [28]these images from the events.

   Support for Canon PowerShot A5 Zoom
   
   Henri Bergius [29]<Henri.Bergius@iki.fi> writes
   
     I am working as Webmaster for a medium-sized software company here
     in Finland. All our web work is done with Open Source software, and
     our web team is actively participating in some OSS projects, like
     the Midgard Web Application Server.
     
     Yesterday, the marketing dept. brought us a new digital camera,
     Canon PowerShot A5 Zoom, which they intend to use for documenting
     events and seminars the company is in. Managing the camera
     (downloading and indexing pictures, etc.) would be the web team's
     job.
     
     As the web team uses Linux computers, I went looking whether the
     camera would be supported in UNIX enviroment (I would hate having
     to get us a NT box just because of the camera). Alas, I noticed
     that no Canon cameras were mentioned in you page.
     
     Now what I am asking is whether there is already someone working on
     supporting the camera. And if not, then how we could help having
     support for it in gPhoto.
     
     If needed, I have one programmer who could possibly help you in the
     project, but all that time is, of course, something that has to be
     taken off from working on Midgard. But whatever, we would like to
     help your team to get the camera to list of supported ones.
     
   Update: Henri Bergius has now pointed out that the offer for help
   which he voiced was about helping an already existing camera support
   project, not about creating a new one.
   
   So if you are working on a Canon A5 driver, please contact the
   [30]gphoto-devel [31]mailinglist.

   Casio QV library in CVS
   
   Gary Ross [32]<gdr@hooked.net> writes
   
     I've checked in my code for the Casio support. It works for me on
     my QV-10 and I believe it'll work ok for all but QV 700 models.
     It's a first rev so most likely there will be some clean up to do
     yet. Give it a try and let me know how it works out.
     
   Get the latest source from [33]CVS, visit the list of known
   [34]supported camera models and send [35]feedback to the gPhoto
   [36]development team.

   Toolbar
   
   The human mind is excellent in recognizing graphics, patterns, faces,
   pictures, etceteras. That's why charts and diagrams are so popular.
   
   'A picture says more than a thousand words'.
   
   Pictures are recognizable. The human eye recognizes a picture a lot
   easier than text. Road signs have pictures, and for a good reason.
   
   The icons on the gPhoto toolbar are perhaps not self explanatory.

   It takes time to learn the meaning, usually a short initial effort.
   Pull downs are easier to learn, which makes them good for low
   frequency functions. An inexperienced user can explore all menu
   options easily. The experienced gPhoto users will probably prefer the
   keyboard shortcuts, or the command line interface (CLI).

   New Site Theme
   
   No, this isn't [44]slashdot.org. It's the result of a tweak with the
   PHP includes file which looks a lot better - my opinion of course -
   than the old grey page. Tux has a new camera too! Enjoy

   Konica Q-M100 and Hewlett Packard C20/C30 support in fast progress
   
   Phill Hugo [45]<plh102@york.ac.uk> has implemented a basic gphoto
   library for the Konica Q-M100 and Hewlett Packard C20/C30 camera
   models, based on the protocol details by Jesper Skov
   [46]<jskov@cygnus.co.uk>.
   
   Konica, like too many camera manufacturers, has not released free
   specs yet, so their camera is limited to the following camera
   operations:
     * Get pictures (Real thumbnails work now!)
     * Delete pictures (buggy due to Konica's gap method)
     * Get status (all the info the camera knows about, picture count,
       time, etc.)
     * NEW! Take picture (with default settings (I'll work on a dialog to
       select flash, focus and exposure modes, etc)
       
   A config option is in progress, to allow formatting of the CF card.
   Eventually, when/if Konica release the camera specs to the free
   software community, I [47]<plh102@york.ac.uk> will add all the other
   stuff these cameras can do over the serial wire. (Change exposure
   settings, shutter speed, flash mode, f-stops, etc.)

   A reverse engineer of the Konica Q-M100
   
   Phill Hugo [49]<plh102@york.ac.uk> sent us Jesper Skov's
   [50]<jskov@cygnus.co.uk> perl script that download pictures from the
   Konica Q-M100 camera. For now it is the only way to get pictures from
   the camera until Phill converts it to a gPhoto plugin. It is likely to
   also work with the Hewlett Packard C20 and C30 since they OEMd their
   hardware from Konica.

   Code organization
   
   Matt has splitted the UI code out of 'main.c'. Things build normally.
   Most of the individual camera libs need to be fixed up in this way
   also. They should by dynamically loaded when needed as with SANE, or
   the executable will balloon over time. Also, every single lib in
   [52]CVS must be functional for the thing to build at all (without
   messing with the code). Maybe this could be fixed with a dynamic
   loading approach...
   
   Any volunteers?
   
   Send mail to [53]gphoto-devel@gphoto.org if you'd like to help.

   Scott shifts focus from gPhoto to SohoVoice
   
   Scott Fritzinger, the main gPhoto developer, posted [54]this
   announcement to the [55]gphoto-devel mailinglist.
   He's working on a new, cool Linux-application called SohoVoice, and
   will focus on that.
   
                             February 13, 1999
                                      
   Keyboard accelerator group and various modifications
   
   Matt added a add_to_menu_acc function call to create a menu entry with
   acclerator. This could/should be combined with the add_to_menu
   function if it doesn't crash-and-burn for anyone.
   
   He also defined some keys for random functions:
     * get index (ctrl-i)
     * get empty index (ctrl-e)
     * select all (ctrl-a)
     * select none (ctrl-n)
     * close (ctrl-c)
     * quit (ctrl-q)
       
   It might make sense to have a function call in the camera API, which
   gets some lightweight info about a photo (ie: camera's internal
   filename or number), so the label is more informative.
     * Added a label to each thumbnail, which contains the 'info' string.
       Since that string is empty, the photo number is sprinted into
       there.
     * Moved index creation to a new function 'makeindex', which takes an
       argument to select thumbnails or an empty index. Two functions
       call makeindex, one is the original 'getindex'. The other is a new
       'getindex_empty' function which calls makeindex with thumbnails
       disabled.
     * Moved thumbnail downloading to a separate function
       'insert_thumbnail'
     * Intercepted button presses to 'thumb_click' function a double
       click will (re)load the thumbnail (calling insert_thumbnail)

   Past versions posted
   
   Scott has updated the 'download' page with [56]a link to the past
   versions of gphoto (0.0.1-1 up to 0.1.2-DR), just in case someone
   wants a past version for some reason.
   
   We are trying to keep the [57]CVS source compiling at all times. This
   means that grabbing the source from there will 99% of the time give
   you source that compiles, but doesn't guarantee to work.
