                gphoto-suite
		------------
		
gphoto-suite is an "umbrella package" which contains 
required (sub)packages related to libgphoto2 in one convenient package.

gphoto-suite makes compiling and installing from scratch easier for

  - people without much compilation experience
  - people who use cross compilation environments
  - people who run test builds and runtime tests
  - people who build integrated binary packages of libgphoto2 and gphoto2


Legal stuff:
------------

gphoto-suite includes multiple packages which are mostly licensed under
GPL or LGPL. See the respective packages for details.


Quick Start:
------------

First, look into gphoto-suite/src/ and make sure that only the software
packages you want built are there - none more, none less.

Then, depending on your desired directory layout, choose one of the
following Quick Start n of 3 sections.


Quick Start 1 of 3:
-------------------

Directory layout (works for development and testing):
 
  someplace
  +- gphoto-suite   source code
     +- _b          built files (object files and stuff)
     +- _i          properly installed files (binaries, libs, docs)

Of course, you can replace the relative _i directory with an absolute
directory like $HOME/usr or /usr/local.

Disadvantage: A simple "grep -r" will grep both source and binaries.

    svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gphoto/trunk/gphoto-suite gphoto-suite
    cd gphoto-suite
    autoreconf -vis
    mkdir _b
    cd _b
    ../configure --prefix=$PWD/../_i
    make all
    make install
    ../_i/bin/gphoto2 --list-cameras


Quick Start 2 of 3:
-------------------

Directory layout (ideal for development and testing):
 
  someplace
  +- gphoto-suite          source code
  +- gphoto-suite-build    built files (object files and stuff)
  +- gphoto-suite-install  properly installed files (binaries, libs, docs)

Advantage: A simple "grep -r" can grep just the source (without the binaries).

    svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gphoto/trunk/gphoto-suite gphoto-suite
    mkdir gphoto-suite-build
    autoreconf -vis gphoto-suite
    cd gphoto-suite-build
    ../gphoto-suite/configure --prefix=$PWD/../gphoto-suite-install
    make all
    make install
    ../gphoto-suite-install/bin/gphoto2 --list-cameras


Quick Start 3 of 3:
-------------------

Directory layout (ideal for one-off installation):
 
  someplace
  +- gphoto-suite   source code and built files (object files and stuff)
  /my/usr           properly installed files (binaries, libs, docs)

Common values for /my/usr would be $HOME/usr/gphoto, $HOME/usr or /usr/local.

Advantage: Simple instructions.

    svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gphoto/trunk/gphoto-suite gphoto-suite
    cd gphoto-suite
    autoreconf -vis
    ./configure --prefix=/my/usr
    make all
    make install
    /my/usr/bin/gphoto2 --list-cameras


Getting gphoto-suite from SVN:
------------------------------

Get gphoto-suite via SVN and change into its directory:

    svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gphoto/trunk/gphoto-suite gphoto-suite

This downloads the programs from the gphoto project SVN.



Getting gphoto-suite from source tarball:
-----------------------------------------

If you got gphoto-suite from a tarball, the source subdirectories
should already be there.


Make sure required (or optional) dependencies are installed:
------------------------------------------------------------

Highest importance:
    pkgconfig
    libusb-dev libexif-dev libjpeg-dev
    libpopt-dev libltdl-dev

Recommended:
    libreadline-dev

Less important:
    doxygen

Optional:
    libaa-dev


Initialize the buildsystem:
---------------------------

This step is only required for SVN/CVS checkouts or if you have just
added new SVN directories to src/.

If you have only added the contents of a source tarball to src/, then
you do *not* need it.

    autoreconf --install --symlink [ --verbose ]


Configure the build system:
---------------------------

This step is required regardless of the method you used to get
gphoto-suite.

Run

    ./configure --help=recursive

to get help on all the parameters for subprojects.

Note that some subproject options will be automatically set by
gphoto-suite. This mostly concerns the *_CFLAGS and *_LIBS
for the libraries gphoto-suite provides by itself.

Then run (for an in-tree build)

    ./configure

with your favourite configure parameters. Or, for an out-of-tree build:

    mkdir ../gphoto-suite-build
    cd ../gphoto-suite-build
    ../gphoto-suite/configure ...

with your favourite configure parameters.

If need be, you can even build the included subprojects by themselves:

    mkdir ../libgphoto2-build
    cd ../libgphoto2-build
    ../gphoto-suite/src/libgphoto2/configure ...


Compilation:
------------

Use the standard commands:

    make
    make install

The latter may be given a DESTDIR= parameter or run as root.


Cross-compilation:
------------------

This is an example using "i586-mingw32msvc" as the system for which
you want to compile (i.e. i586-mingw32msvc-gcc will be the compiler).
The build system for this example is i686-pc-linux (you can run
config.guess to determine the build system).

Note that you may want *not* to use

    ../configure --prefix=/foo/bar/usr ...
    make all
    make install

but

    ../configure --prefix=/usr ...
    make all
    make DESTDIR=/foo/bar install

if you have the "root" (/) directory of the system the stuff is
supposed to run on mapped into /foo/bar. It depends on your setup.

You can build gphoto-suite for that platform by running:

    mkdir _win32 && cd _win32
    ../configure --prefix=/tmp/lt-win32-inst \
        --host=i586-mingw32msvc --build=i686-pc-linux
    make all
    make install

If you have an emulator properly installed for the binaries, even
"make check" will give results. Yes, you can compile and test Windows
binaries on a Linux system!


Run the tests:
--------------

Run

    make check

and examine the output.


Check the distribution mechanism:
---------------------------------

Run

    make distcheck

and see whether it finishes without errors.
