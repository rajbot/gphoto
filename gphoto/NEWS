gPhoto 0.4.3

January 27, 2000

For immidiate release.

The gPhoto project members announce the release of gPhoto 0.4.3, 
the GNU digital still camera application, on January 27, 2000.

gPhoto is a digital still camera software application for free 
Unix-like systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and RedHat Linux, written 
by Scott Fritzinger <scottf@scs.unr.edu> -- with assistance from
developers around the world. It is freely available and distributed 
on the terms of the GNU General Public License. The GNU GPL is
intended to guarantee freedom to share and change software such
as gPhoto--to make sure it is free for all its users.

gPhoto 0.4.3 ships with 17 different camera libraries and supports 108
different digital still camera models, from Agfa, Apple, Canon, Casio,
Chinon, Epson, Fuji, Hewlett Packard, Kodak, Konica, Minolta, Mustek,
Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Philips, Polaroid, Ricoh, Sanyo, Samsung 
and Sony.

See http://www.gphoto.org/libs.html for a list of supported camera 
models.

Casio, Kodak, Minolta, Mustek, and Konica provide free, open camera
communication specifications. The gPhoto developers encourage other
vendors to also release specs to their latest and upcoming digital
camera models. It is always a great help for potential camera
customers to ask companies if they support gPhoto before you invest in
a camera.
