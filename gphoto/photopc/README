This is a library and a command-line frontend to manipulate digital
still cameras based on Fujitsu chipset and Sierra Imaging firmware.  The
program is known to work with Agfa, Epson, Olympus, Sanyo and Nikon (at
least CoolPix 900, but not CoolPix 600!) cameras.

The cameras typically come with software for Windows and for Mac, and no
description of the protocol.  With this tool, they are managable from a
UNIX box.  Bruce D. Lightner <lightner@lightner.net> has added support
for Win32 and DOS platforms.  Note that the program does not have any
GUI, it is plain command-line even on Windows.

I tried it under Linux/x86, FreeBSD and Solaris/SPARC, and it should be
straightforward for other UNIX systems.

Generally, UNIX system requirements are:
- ANSI C compiler (theoretically should work with K&R but unchecked)
- select() system call
- POSIX termios
- presence of a 16bit integer type
- serial port (with or without `modem control').

On UNIX, first run "./configure".  Then, typing `make' will result
in building the library and executables in the current directory.
`make install' will install the executables, library and manual pages.
If your `make' supports VPATH (e.g. GNU make), it is possible to build
objects and executables in a different directory; create target directory
and run /path/to/photopc/configure.  If you are building from CVS source
see instructions at the end of this file.

To build for DOS and WIN32, chdir to "dos" or "win32" directories
respectively and there type "make".

The executable parameters are rather clear (hopefully).  Running
`photopc -h | more' will print the list of options and commands.
If you are going to use the library for your own application and need
the docs, tell me and I will write them.

On UNIX systems that have sched_setcheduler() function the program
can set itself "realtime priority".  That makes it less vulnerable to
possible timeouts caused by high system load, and, more important,
use high-resolution mode of nanosleep() function.  That means that
it may run a bit quicker (but you probably will not notice anyway).
Make the progrem setuid root to use this mode.  There is hopefully no
danger because it revokes root privileges really quickly (even before
processing command-line options).

Included file `protocol.htm' contains description of the protocol used
by the camera.

`usage.htm' is a "casual" user's guide, full description is in the man
pages.

If you run the program on a DOS box, you may want a JPEG viewer;
I've been told that a good free viewer `LXPIC' can be found at
http://home.t-online.de/home/stefan.peichl.  Also, there is a
tool that may help in discovering serial protocols (although
*I* did not use it when I examined that camera's protocol):
http://www.endymion.com/portfolio/software/comlite32.htm

Many commands may be unimplemented, esp. those specific for newer models.
If you know how to do things that the program currently cannot do,
please let me know.

I can be contacted at <crosser@average.org>, fresh version of this tool
(if any) is at ftp://ftp.average.org/pub/photopc/, related information
is at http://www.average.org/digicam/.  The same code accompanied by
Win32 and DOS executables and archived in .zip format can be found at
http://www.lightner.net/lightner/bruce/photopc/

Thanks to Jeff Tranter for contributing the man page and a few bugfixes,
Bruce Lightner for Windows and DOS support, Thierry Bousch for many
details of the protocol and advice, Sergey I. Panov for invaluable
investigation of the folder navigation means and other people who helped
me to track down problems and learn more about the protocol.
