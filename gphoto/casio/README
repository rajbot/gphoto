Here are a couple of troubleshooting tips to start out:

	1) As root run:
		/sbin/setserial <camera port> auto_irq autoconfig
	   If it's a high speed serial port, add spd_vhi to the command

	2) shutting off the camera and turning it back on resets the
	   camera to a known good state. If you get timeout errors
	   this is the first thing to try.

	3) If you get problems during download try setting the connection
	   speed to a lower rate. The default speed, 9600 baud, is the
	   lowest speed setting and should work if evrything else is
	   configured properly.
