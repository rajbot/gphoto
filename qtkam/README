                   QtKam: A Qt/KDE interface to gPhoto2
                   ------------------------------------

            THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET ! DON'T USE IT !

What is QtKam ?
---------------
QtKam is a graphical frontend for gphoto2, using the Qt and KDE libraries.
For the moment, we aim at making the GUI functional for KDE. 
In the future, we're going to make a 'light' version of QtKam, for which
the KDE libraries won't be necessary.



Requirements
------------
* libgphoto2: the gphoto2 library, which can be obtained at 
              http://www.gphoto.net

* KDE libraries: can be found at http://www.kde.org

* Qt: a graphical toolkit. The KDE libraries are based on this toolkit, so
      when you have those, you should have the Qt libraries too. 
      More info on Qt can be found at http://www.trolltech.com/
               
* To be able to view thumbnails, you need either
    - JPEG support compiled in your Qt libs (compiled with the '-system-jpeg' 
      option)
    - JPEG support compiled in your KDE libs (doesn't seem to work yet)

* And of course: a C++ compiler.
