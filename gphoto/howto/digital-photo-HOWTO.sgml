  <title>Digital Photo Technologies</title>

  <para>
  With traditional photography you have to wait for Polaroids, then you 
  have to wait for the film to be developed, then you have to wait for 
  the color separations, not to mention all of the messengers between
  all those stops. That's a lot of time and money being spent.</para>

  <para>Digital image devices are the newest got-to-have-it peripheral 
  for your computer. They supply instant gratification in the form of
  a digital image you can immediately pop into a document, print, or
  send off as e-mail to your friend. For fun, ease of use, and
  immediate impact, digital photo devices can't be beat. But they are not
  all created equal.</para>

    <title>Digital Cameras</title>

    <para>Digital cameras have the balance of quality, features, and 
    price that appeals to users looking for a fast and convenient
    way to get images into their PC. You can spend a lot more -- or
    a lot less -- for one than the $400 to $1000 these cost, but you 
    won't like the quality at the low end or the prices at the high end. 
    With digital cameras, the best place to be is in the middle.</para>

    <para>No other image-capture option for your computer matches the fun, 
    immediacy, and convenience of a digital camera. Unlike with a 
    scanner, you don't need an already-existing image: A digital 
    camera lets you capture what you see. And unlike film-to-disk 
    services, a digital camera is immediate: You don't have to wait 
    hours or days before you can use an image on your computer.</para>
  
    <para>Operating a digital camera is also inexpensive, because the only 
    recurring cost is batteries. The camera's storage is reusable once you
    download a batch of images. And since you don't have to pay for film 
    processing, you can go wild.</para>
  
    <para>Don't expect digital photo technology to replace film cameras yet.
    They're still years away from challenging regular cameras in image 
    quality and even in features for the price. Pictures from film
    cameras have resolutions of many thousands of dots per inch; most
    digital cameras have resolutions under 100 dpi. If your
    application requires the highest  possible image quality, your
    best bet is to use a film camera and then scan the processed
    photo.  You'll be better off using digital cameras for screen-oriented 
    applications such as e-mail attachments and for non-professional 
    printing applications.</para>

    <para>There are dramatic differences among digital cameras.
    Here's what to look for:</para>

      <sect2>
      <title>Features</title>

      <para>Although the image quality produced by digital still cameras
      still lags behind 35mm film, the latest crop of PC-ready cameras
      moves a lot closer to the mark--thanks to megapixel resolutions
      and a raft of nifty new features that make digital picture-taking
      easier than ever.</para>

      <para>Because every photographer is different, only you can decide
      which digital camera is the perfect one for you. Each cameras offer 
      distinct features and capabilities, and you will need to assess each 
      one in terms of your specific skills and intended use. But you really 
      can't lose. Most cameras provide good image quality in a wide variety 
      of conditions.</para>

      <para>Film-less photography also offers many other advantages. Most
      digital cameras store pictures on tiny removable memory cards,
      eliminating the expense associated with buying and processing
      film. You can balance file size against image quality by setting
      the resolution and compression level of each picture, and many
      digital cameras provide both a conventional glass view-finder
      and an LCD that lets you compose photographs, review stored
      pictures, and use on-screen menus to adjust settings. Photos
      appear on the screen only a few seconds after you shoot them,
      and if you're unhappy with what you see, they can be easily
      deleted. Stored photographs are normally downloaded through a
      serial port. Most vendors sell adapters that let you insert
      memory cards into a floppy drive or PC Card slot.</para>
      
      <para>If you want to play the photos back right away as a slide show
      on your TV, then a camera with a video-out port is essential.  
      Also, if you need to take extreme close-ups, get a camera with
      a macro lens; automatic flash and exposure control are
      standard on digital cameras, but special items such as zoom
      lenses are not. You should also make sure you're comfortable
      with the camera's weight and the placement of its buttons.</para>
      
      <para>Inexpensive Megapixel Digital Cameras range (in June '99,
      when this was written) in price from $350 to $599, and you 
      can get at least 4MB of storage, a LCD screen, built-in flash, 
      and 1,152x864 resolution from Eastman Kodak Co. and Konica, who 
      provide protocol specifications to free software developers.</para>

      <para>Many of the features--such as autofocusing lenses, 
      ----self-timers, and special red-eye-reducing flash modes--will 
      seem familiar to anyone who owns a late-model film camera. Some 
      new digital models even emulate the functions of zoom lenses, 
      motorized power winders, and panoramic cameras.</para>

      <para>Comparing digital cameras is no more complicated than 
      comparing film cameras once you understand what the possible
      features are. Here's a glossary of features that you may find:

        <sect3>
	<title>35mm Lens Equivalent</title>
	<para>Digital Cameras utilize different lens lengths than the
	traditional 35mm cameras. In order to make any useful comparison,
	manufacturers offer an equivalent lens length to 35mm cameras.
	There are three basic types of lenses that come on Digital Cameras:
	Wide Angle, Normal and Telephoto. Wide Angle lenses have lengths
	which generally range from 25-40mm. Normal lenses have lengths
	ranging from 45-55mm. Normal lenses are closest to those in our own
	eyes. Telephoto lenses begin roughly at 100mm and continue much
	higher. In rare cases, equivalent lens lengths were unattainable,
	and actual lens lengths are given instead.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Aperture</title>
	<para>The Aperture is the lens opening that allows light to hit the
	image sensor inside the Digital Camera. Apertures are measured as
	f-stops (F). The f-stop is inversely related to the size of the
	lens opening; the larger the f-stop the smaller the opening.
	Digital Cameras in this search have either Fixed Apertures, which
	do not allow you to make adjustments or Aperture Ranges which do
	allow you to make adjustments. Many Digital Cameras do have
	different Fixed Apertures to choose form.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Audio Recording</title>
	<para>This feature allows you to record sound bites with the image, to
	annotate each shot.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: You can capture your thoughts at the exact moment
	you take a photograph.</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Battery Type</title>
	<para>This specifies the type of batteries that come with the Digital
	Camera. Cameras that are Tethered are powered directly from the
	computer.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Color Depth</title>
	<para>Digital Cameras create colors using red, green and blue. A
	camera with 24-bit color will have 8 bits per channel. This will
	produce 256 different shades per channel. The end result is a
	camera capable of reproducing millions of different colors.
	Greyscale refers to black and white images.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Continuous Shooting</title>
	<para>This feature allows the camera to take multiple shots in a row.
	Most cameras take at least one frame per second.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Continuous Shooting helps to capture high speed
	sequences, such as a golf swing, and can also act as motion
	video.</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Dimensions (HxWxD)</title>
	<para>The dimensions of the Digital Camera, measured in inches (Height
	x Width x Depth).</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Flash</title>
	<para>A device that produces a burst of light for your picture. There
	are several different options that may come with the flash. Some
	cameras have automatic flash, which means that the camera decides
	when more light is needed for the picture and then fires the flash
	automatically. Other options include manual over ride, always on,
	always off and red eye reduction. Red Eye Reduction is helpful when
	taking pictures of people. With red eye reduction, all your friends
	and relatives won't appear to be vampires in every shot.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Focus</title>
	<para>This feature allows you to adjust the lens of the camera to
	produce the sharpest image possible. Digital Cameras have two
	different kinds of focusing, Fixed Focus and Auto Focus. Fixed
	Focus comes set by the manufacturer and you cannot make any
	adjustments. In some cameras there are multiple Fixed Focus
	settings that you may select. Cameras with Auto Focus will actually
	make all the adjustments necessary to produce the sharpest image
	for you. All you have to do is point and let the camera do the
	work.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Image Capacity</title>
	<para>The number of images that the Digital Camera can store at its
	minimum resolution or highest compression mode. This number usually
	relates to lower quality images. <i>Note: This number reflects
	image capacity with standard memory only. Most manufacturers offer
	additional memory which can greatly increase storage
	capacity.</i></para>
	<para><em>Benefit: The more images a camera can hold without additional
	memory the better.</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Image Capacity at Max Res.</title>
	<para>This notes the number of images the Digital Camera can store at
	its highest resolution or lowest compression mode. Note: This
	number usually relates to high quality images.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Interface</title>
	<para>This is the method in which your Digital Camera and Computer
	communicate. A Serial or Parallel interface connects with a port in
	the back of your desktop. PCMCIA interfaces plug directly into
	laptops. Other methods of communication between computer and
	Digital Camera include Infrared (wireless), SCSI, and even 3.5-inch
	Floppy Disks.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>ISO Equivalent</title>
	<para>Traditional 35mm cameras use the International Standards
	Organization (ISO) to determine film speed.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: The higher the ISO number, the less light needed for
	the picture. Digital Cameras do not use traditional film, so the
	industry uses an equivalency rating. This rating specifies the
	Digital Camera's sensitivity to lighting. For example, ISO 100
	could be used for sunny outside shots, while ISO 800 could take
	candlelight stills with no flash.</em></para>
	</sect3>
	
	<sect3>
	<title>LCD Size (in)</title>
	<para>The size of the LCD viewfinder screen measured
	diagonally in inches.</para>
	</sect3>
	
	<sect3>
	<title>Macro</title>
	<para>A lens that can take close-up shots, approximately one foot or
	closer.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Camera has the ability to take extremely close-up
	shots.</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Max. Resolution</title>
	<para>Each digital image is comprised of thousands of tiny dots called
	pixels. Resolution equals the number of horizontal pixels
	multiplied by the number of vertical pixels. The more pixels per
	image, the better the clarity of the picture.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: The higher the Max Resolution, the better the
	picture. High resolution doesn't come cheap and requires much more
	memory per picture.</em></para>

	<sect3>
	<title>On Camera Editing</title>
	<para>This feature allows you to manipulate the amount of photos on
	the cameras has stored in its memory.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: This will allow you to delete unwanted pictures from
	the camera, freeing up storage space. If you don't like a shot,
	this feature lets you to immediately delete it rather than waiting
	to download the images to the computer. Cameras with LCD screens
	may offer other options. Some cameras can show one to 12 pictures
	simultaneously on the screen and allow you to edit each shot
	individually or all at once.</em></para>

	<sect3>
	<title>Other Resolution Modes</title>
	<para>Optional settings to vary the quality of image stored in the
	camera's memory.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Sometimes expressed in the manufacturer's verbal
	interpretation (Good, Better, Best), rather than in pixels.
	Resolution equals the number of horizontal pixels multiplied by the
	number of vertical pixels. The more pixels per image the better the
	clarity of the picture. High-resolution images take up more of the
	camera's memory. Cameras that allow you to switch resolutions give
	you the option of saving valuable storage space at the expense of
	image quality.</em></para>
	<para><em>Compression reduces the size of the data, allowing for
	additional pictures to be stored in the camera's memory. Compressed
	data has to be expanded before use, which causes the images to lose
	some of their clarity, in essence reducing the resolution. Some
	photo software, like gPhoto, have the ability to increase the 
	resolution after the image has been downloaded into the
	computer.</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Red Eye Reduction</title>
	<para><!-- No glossary entry for this item. --></para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Red eye reduction is helpful when taking pictures of
	people. With red eye reduction, all your friends and relatives
	won't appear to be vampires in every shot.</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Self Timer</title>
	<para>Automatic timer you set to take a picture in a set amount of
	time.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Tired of having everyone in your pictures but you?
	Simply set the timer (most average around 10 seconds), and get in
	the shot!</em></para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Shutter Speed</title>
	<para>The camera's shutter is a device which opens and closes,
	allowing light to hit its image sensor. Shutter Speed refers to the
	amount of time the shutter stays open and is measured in fractions
	of a second.</para>
	</sect3>

	<sect3>
	<title>Storage Type</title>
	<para>There are two types of storage for Digital Cameras, internal and
	removable. Internal storage comes inside the camera, and usually
	cannot be altered. In a few cases, manufacturers will put
	additional memory inside the camera, at additional costs. Once the
	internal memory is full, download the images to the computer and
	start again. Some cameras have On Camera Editing features which
	allow you to preview and delete at the camera. This can free up
	internal storage space without having to download.</para>
	<para><em>Removable Storage</em> is Digital Camera memory that can be
	replaced. As soon as one card is full, pull it out, insert another
	and keep shooting. There are several types of removable storage
	medium with varying capacity. CompactFlash, SmartMedia (SSFDC), and
	Miniature Cards are the three most common types of removable
	storage. Each come in a variety of densities, anywhere from 2MB to
	64MB and beyond. Another type of removable storage is Type II or
	III PCMCIA cards which can insert directly into laptop computers.
	Some manufacturers use their own proprietary removable storage
	medium, while others can use every day 3.5-inch floppy disks. There
	is no set standard in the industry at this time.</para>
	<para>Digital Cameras that are <em>Tethered</em> to the
	computer have no storage capacity of their own. Images are 
	downloaded directly to the computer's hard drive or floppy
	disk.  Capacity is therefore dependent on the computer's disk 
	space.  Those cameras are usually referred to as "webcams".</para>
	</sect3>	
	
	<sect3>
	<title>Video Out</title>
	<para>The Video Out feature allows you to plug the Digital Camera
	directly into a TV or VCR.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Preview or edit your images on a full size
	television screen. Plug into the VCR and transfer your images to a
	VHS tape.</em></para>
	</sect3>	

	<sect3>
	<title>Viewfinder</title>
	<para>The device used to preview your image before taking the picture.
	Digital Cameras have two kinds of viewfinders, optical and LCD.
	Optical viewfinders require you to put the camera up to your eye to
	see what you are shooting at. LCDs (Liquid Crystal Display) are
	flat screens that display images on a 1-3 inch screen. LCDs can
	also display camera functions and battery life. Batteries tend to
	last significantly less when using the LCD screen. Some cameras
	have both optical viewfinders and LCDs.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: Allows you to preview what your picture will look
	like before you waste a picture.</em></para>
	</sect3>	

	<sect3>
	<title>Zoom</title>
	<para>Lenses that can change Focal Lengths are Zoom Lenses. A camera's
	Focal Length is the distance at which the lens brings light into
	focus.</para>
	<para><em>Benefit: A large Focal Length will make distant
	subjects appear closer.</em></para>
	</sect3>
      </sect1>

    <sect1>
    <title>Pitfalls</title>
    <para>Many digital devices come with proprietary software or no 
    software at all for GNU/Linux systems for transferring data to 
    your computer.</para>

    <para>You should consider to write your manufacturer and ask
    them to open the protocol specs, to enable camera drivers for
    free photo software such gPhoto (GNU Photo) to be written.</para>

      <sect2>
      <title>Kodak PhotoCD</title>
      <em><idx>PhotoCD</idx></em> is a semi-open standard developed by 
      Kodak for storing photographic images as digital data on a
      CD-ROM.  AFAIK, you can only view the images on a computer with 
      proprietary software from Eastman Kodak.
      </sect2>

      <sect2>
      <title>Canon PowerShot</title>
      Unfortunately, <em><idx>Canon Inc.</idx></em> refuse to
      disclosure the protocol details for their camera models, 
      necessary to write free software drivers for gPhoto yet.
