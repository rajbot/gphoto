The program show_mr_raw will convert a raw file from most of the known 
cameras supported in libgphoto2/camlibs/mars into a viewable PPM file. The 
file will be saved, and the image contained in the file will be displayed in 
an X window. To close the program, close the window. The output file will be
saved. The name of the output file will look like mrpic***ppm. An image file 
created by libgphoto2/camlibs/mars will have a similar name, but with a "." 
before the ppm. The reason why the filenames put out from this program are 
slightly different is that the output of this program and of the mars camera 
library will be close together if in the same directory, whereas at the same 
time there will be no name conflicts. As one of the purposes of the 
show_mr_raw program is to try to improve the image processing for the Mars
cameras, this feature will therefore allow easy comparison of the image 
resulting from two different processing routines. 

The program should automatically detect and handle compressed files, and also 
should automatically detect the output dimensions. The user is warned, however,
that raw files created with a version of camlibs/mars/library,c prior to 
September 23, 2006 do _not_ contain the needed information about the output 
dimensions of the finished photo. The default dimensions of the output file 
are considered here as 176*144, which will give rather bad results unless that 
really is the appropriate resolution setting. If you have such old raw files 
from a Mars camera lying around and really want to get photos from them, then 
it is of course possible to add the needed information. Please see the 
sourcecode or the file README.mars in libgphoto2/camlibs/mars to see how I 
added this information to the raw files. 

The program is written to accept raw files which were the output of 
gphoto2 --get-all-raw-data 
or 
gphoto2 --get-raw-data (number or range of numbers, or file name(s)). The  
raw files will have names which look like raw_mrpic***.raw in which *** is the 
number of the photo. A sample script file should also be present here, which 
will successively run the program through all of the raw files in a directory, 
provided that the numbering of those raw files is consecutive and starts with 
001. Just put the script and the show_mr_raw executable in the same 
directory with the raw files and run the script. The first image will be 
displayed and will remain displayed until you close the window in which it sits.
At that point, the second image will be displayed, and so on until you have 
opened all of the photos.  

There are many MR97310 cameras. Some of them use a compression algorithm for 
all photos; some of them run only in uncompressed mode, and some of them offer
the user a choice of compressed mode or uncomrpressed mode. Unfortunately, 
too, it is known that there exist two compression algorithms which are used 
in Mars cameras. The decompression of photos taken with one of these algorithms 
is supported, but the other decompression algorithm, alas, is different. If 
your camera is running that "bad" compression algorithm, then I am sorry that
I cannot help you at this time. Rather, perhaps I am lucky enough that you will 
be able to help _me_. For a discussion of the known cameras, whether they use 
a compression algorithm or not, and if so, which one, please consult 
libgphoto2/camlibs/mars/README.mars. 

As stated, there are many MR97310 cameras. Another consequence of this is that 
there is a bewildering variety of sensors used behind the lens. As a reault, 
it is very difficult to write an image postprocessing routine which works 
equally well for all of these cameras. The worst problem is that what appears 
to work very well for some subset of the cameras seems to work atrociously for 
some other subset. The main problem lies in the different color sensitivities 
of the various sensors. The most common problem is that the finished photo 
often looks too green or too blue with some of the cameras. Some of what is 
done here helps a bit with this problem, but the problem still exists. 
Moreover, the USB routines of the Mars cameras have nothing in them which will 
distinguish one camera from a too-large set of other cameras. Unlike what 
happens with some other cameras, there is no such thing as a firmware version 
or other ID string at all. In other words, there is no way that a raw file 
could automatically be marked as coming from a certain camera. 


If you encounter any MR97310 camera which seems to require other processing 
options which are not incorporated here and which are not already listed and 
described in README.mars, or if there are any other problems 
remaining with the raw conversion program which prevent it from doing its job, 
then please let me know. 

The standard warranty disclaimer applies to this program. I do hope that you 
find the program useful and enjoyable. If you are a developer working on 
support for these or similar digital cameras, I hope that you will find it 
helpful in your work.
