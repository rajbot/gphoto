License.  The GNU GPL is intended to guarantee freedom to share and change

gPhoto 0.4.3 ships with 19 different camera libraries and supports 114 
different digital still camera models, from Agfa, Apple, Canon, Casio, 
Chinon, Epson, Fuji, Hewlett Packard, Kodak, Konica, Minolta, Mustek, 
Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Philips, Polaroid, Ricoh, Sanyo, Samsung, 
and Sony.

Casio, Kodak, Minolta, Mustek, and Konica provide free, open camera
communication specifications. The gPhoto developers encourage other vendors to
also release specs to their latest and upcoming digital camera models. It is
always a great help for potential camera customers to ask companies if they
support gPhoto before you invest in a camera.
