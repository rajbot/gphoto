				    libgpfs
				    -------

libgpfs is cool stuff. Believe me. Especially for digital cameras, where a 
file is actually different files: A preview, a full size image, an associated
audio file, raw data, etc. libgpfs has been written to handle that.

In short: A filesystem (GPFs) contains files (GPFsFile) that can have 
multiple interfaces (GPFsIf). Each interface has a name, provides some 
pieces of information (i.e. that "size" is "1024"). Last but not least you
can read data from that interface.

So far so good. Now, you probably want to cache some data you get from the
filesystem (i.e. the structure). For that, libgpfs provides caching
functionality (GPFsCache). Use it if you like it, don't use it if you don't
like it.

The licence is LGPL, by the way.
