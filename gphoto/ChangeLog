	Fixes a few minor problems and adds downloading of arbitrary files.
	
	The downloading can be reached via Configure/Configure Camera. The
	window that appears has the following functions:  - clicking on any
	file downloads that file  - "Clear camera cache" resets all camera
	information cached in the driver.     This does _not_ include
	images already downloaded into gPhoto or such.	   This function is
	useful if camera and gPhoto have lost synchronization.	 - "Done"
	simply closed the window
	
	Note that any change in the cached data while the configure window
	is open is likely to produce a crash if clicking on a file name.
	The main purpose of the download function is to explore the data
	generated by the camera, e.g. the .CTG files, so it's not overly
	user-friendly.

	Canon A50 support to gphoto, *despite* Canon Inc.'s lack of
	co-operation:
	
	From: Werner Almesberger <almesber@lrc.di.epfl.ch> Subject:
	[gphoto-devel] Canon A50, 1st try To: gphoto-devel@gphoto.org Date:
	Sun, 29 Aug 1999 13:12:41 +0200 (MET DST)
	
	There's a patch that adds a primitive Canon A50 driver to
	gphoto-0.3.6-pre (as on CVS) in
	ftp://lrcftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/junk/psa50-2.patch.gz
	
	It's the work of Wolfgang Reissnegger and me. Most of the details
	were found my staring at Ray Newman's A5 traces. Also, the analysis
	of the PS350 protocol by Anne Bezemer was quite helpful for
	understanding the overall design.
	
	Note that I've taken over the gphoto/canon directory instead of
	using a sub-directory, like gphoto/canon/ps350. I did this, because
	the top and bottom ends of the protocols seems to be suficiently
	similar that quite a bit of code may be shared, so we probably
	don't need to treat the Canon cameras like completely different
	devices. Needs more investigation, though.
	
	What works:   Camera/Get Index/No Thumbnails   Get Selected/Images 
	 Camera/Camera Summary	 Configure/Configure Camera
	
	Things that are missing:  - bit rates different from 9600 bps  -
	thumbnails  - any form of useful error recovery
	
	The driver is till quite ugly, and parts of it are rather
	inefficient (e.g. my PII/233Mhz feels rather sluggish when the
	serial code is at work), but if you have plenty of time, it will
	eventually get all the pictures ...
	
	What would be very useful now are traces of the Windows software
	for operations like:  - delete pictures  - get/set date  - a file
	upload	- a download at low speed, during which the cable was
	quickly removed
	
	I don't think the camera firmware supports "take picture" or
	"preview" at all.
	
	Note that the driver probably doesn't work with A5 cameras, because
	of some minor protocol details. Don't know about A5 Zoom.

	* kodak_generic/kodak_dc240_helpers.c: Adding code to count
	checksum/timeout errors.  When 8 errors occur in a single command,
	the command is automatically aborted.  This change is used in
	conjunction with the one that lowers the HPBS when an error occurs
	to attempt to improve performance for those who suffer from chronic
	timeout/checksum errors.

1999-08-05 04:59  scottr

	* kodak_generic/kodak_dc240.c: Updates to make the HPBS variable
	based on the number of errors that were recieved.  When errors
	occur, the HPBS is lowered toward the minimum value (512 bytes). 
	When the error conditions no longer exist, the HPBS is raised
	toward the maximum value (16384 bytes).
	
	The algorithm could probably use a little work (which is obvious
	when you look at the code), but it appears to work well enough for
	now.  This change was added to attempt to help those people that
	suffer from chronic timeout/checksum errors in their packets.  By
	reducing the HPBS, we should be reducing the probability that a
	single packet will be corrupted.
	
	Remeber, however, that the larger the HPBS, the higher the
	throughput because there are fewer "control" bytes passed around. 
	So, don't think that you're solving the world's problems by leaving
	HPBS set at 512 for all eternity.  Some of us actually want a
	larger value.

1999-08-05 04:59  scottr

	* kodak_generic/kodak_dc240_helpers.c: Changing the checksum error
	counter to require 8 checksum errors in a single packet.  It
	certainly wouldnt be unreasnable to expect 8 errors during normal
	operation when downloading a very large image from the camera.

1999-08-04 17:08  scottf

	* konica/: configDialog.c, configDialog.h, dump.c, dump.h,
	konicarc.sample: actually added the files that should be added to
	the konica directory. ;)

1999-08-04 10:20  mmartin

	* fuji/: exif.c, exif.h, fuji_exif.c, gphoto-exifdump.c: Exif
	handling code fixes.  Fractions should be handled correctly now. 
	Also, tags with multiple numbers should work.

1999-08-03 17:00  scottf

	* konica/: Makefile.am, close.c, defs.h, erasePic.c, error.c,

	setSpeed.h, takePic.c, transmission.c, transmission.h: Added Ed
	Legowski's patch to the konica lib. library should work now.  YAY!!
	:)

1999-08-03 04:30  scottr

	* kodak_generic/kodak_dc240.c: Forcing index read before getting a
	picture if it hasnt already been done (so that command-line
	operation works).

1999-08-01 23:01  scottr

	* kodak_generic/state_machine.c: Changed timeout errors in the
	middle of a packet into something that will resemble a checksum
	error.	Hopefully, this will allow the software to request
	retransmissions of corrupted packets from the camera.

1999-07-26 09:22  mmartin

	fuji_exif.c, fujilib.c, gphoto-exifdump.c, gphoto_fuji.h: Minor bug
	hunting, consistency checks,  still needs clean-up.
	
	Sub-IFD tag parsing working thanks to Paul Wood.
	
	Added exifdump into automake, seems to insist on installing it.
	
	Changed name to gphoto-exifdump to lessen chance of overwriting the
	original    exifdump program (not from gphoto).

	uploads. Turns out this wasn't causing the performance problems. It
	is very handy when trying to debug library problems.

1999-07-17 05:38  bpaauwe

	* philips/gphoto_philips.c: Fixed bug that was causing gphoto to
	try and free memory that wasn't allocated because image_info_size
	was a random value by adding line to set image_info_size to 0 in
	philips_get_picture.
