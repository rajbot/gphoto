Some images will return invalid jpegs. This is due to the Dimage V sending
packets with incorrect length values; I compensate as best I can, and am
working on a better way to second-guess the camera. Try reloading the image;
so far, any image that fails will succeed in no more than three attempts.

Attempting to retrieve thumbnails is pointless; right now all that comes
back is a false jpeg which says "Thumbnails don't work yet." This is due to
the bizarre bitmap format that the Dimage V returns for thumbnails. I'm
working on it, but not too hopefully. On that note, if the "image format"
of "Y:Cr:Cb = 4:2:2" means anything, please let me know.

Several secondary features (like taking a picture, or retrieving the current
viewfinder contents) don't work. Right now, retrieving full-sized images and
deleting is really all it does. More will come later, but as the saying goes,
"release early, release often".

The Dimage V does use EXIFs as the file format, which does contain information
about the image, such as the time it was captured, the camera make & model, and
other such data. Currently, I just leave it be. Eventually, I'll borrow the
code from the Fuji library and make this happen automatically, but in the
meantime, if you need the EXIF tags, please look into the exifdump program,
currently distributed in the Fuji directory.
