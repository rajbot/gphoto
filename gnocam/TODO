- Design a clean async interface (gnocam/idl/GnoCam.idl) for
   - capturing
   - configuration (xml?)
   - download
   - feedback (status information!)
- Enhance the applet to include more functionality (which?)
- Write a plugin for the gnome-control-center
- Update EOG to use the new GnoCam.idl and the settings defined
  by the gnome-control-center-plugin
- Let gtkam optionally access the camera through gnocam
- Same with gimp (will make it possible to access the camera 
  through different programs at the same time)
- Make the gnome-vfs-module functional
