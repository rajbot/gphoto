gPhoto is registered in the Gnome and the Debian Bug Tracking System.

http://bugs.gnome.org and http://bugs.debian.org are tracking systems, 
which file details of problems reported by users and staff. Each ticket 
is given a number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been
dealt with.

Please report gPhoto related bugs and problems to these systems.

The gphoto bug ticket status page at bugs.gnome.org is available at
http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgphoto.html, while Debian bug reports for
gphoto are availble at http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/pa/lgphoto.html

A problem report, with mail header, looks something like this:

  To: submit@bugs.gnome.org
  From: ole@gnu.org
  Subject: invoking error

  Package: gphoto
  Version: 0.3.9

  When I invoke `gphoto' without arguments from an ordinary shell
  prompt it prints `goodbye', instead of opening the GTK+ window.

  Here is a transcript:

  $ gphoto
  goodbye
  $ /usr/local/bin/gphoto
  goodbye
  $

  I suggest that the foo() routine, in main.c, be corrected.

  I am using RedHat 6.0, Linux kernel version 2.2.12
  and GNU libc 2.1.1.

Please include in your report:

* The exact and complete text of any error messages printed or
  logged. This is very important!
* Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
* A description of the incorrect behaviour: exactly what behaviour
  you were expecting, and what you observed. A transcript of an
  example session is a good way of showing this.
* A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
* Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
  Include the complete text of its configuration files.

Include any detail that seems relevant - you are in very little danger
of making your report too long by including too much information. If
they are small please include in your report any files you were using
to reproduce the problem (uuencoding them if they may contain odd
characters etc.).

Of course, like any email, you should include a clear, descriptive
Subject line in your main mail header. The subject you give will be
used as the initial ticket title in the tracking system, so please try
to make it informative.

Bug Tracking System.

Thank you!
