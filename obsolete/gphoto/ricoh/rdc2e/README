INTRODUCTION
------------
I bought a Ricoh RDC-2E Digital camera which came with software that only
ran under Microsoft Windows.  Naturally there was no Linux support.

Welcome to version 0.6 of "rdc2e"; a program that runs on Linux which
downloads pictures from the camera.

INSTALLATION
------------
Read the INSTALL file for the (brief) installation instructions.

PREREQUESITS
------------
You will also need to have the JPEG library installed along with "netpbm"
utilities for the "j6itojpg" package to work.

The JPEG library is found on any good Linux/sunsite/metalabs mirror in the
.../libs/graphics/ directory. On a RedHat distribution, use the 'libjpeg'
RPM.

The "netpbm" is also available on a Linux/sunsite/metalabs mirror in the
.../apps/graphics/convert/ directory. On a RedHat distribution, use the
'libgr-progs' RPM.

It is also HIGHLY recomended that you install 'irqtune' to improve the
performance of your serial port.  http://www.best.com/~cae/irqtune
This sets the IRQ priority of the serial higher than that of the 
disk drives. If you don't, then expect to get CRC errors a lot of the
time.

HOW TO USE
----------
This is a command line tool that is pretty basic in its use.

The easiest way to use it would be to use no options, and ALL images
in the cameras memory (not the PCMCIA card) will be downloaded to the
local directory using the internal names for each image.  These are
r0100001.j6i, r0100002.j6i, etc.

look at the man page ("man rdc2e") for an explanation of the command line
arguements.

Then use the "j6iextract" command installed in /usr/local/bin to convert them to
GIF, JPEG or TIFF files. Again, read the man page ("man j6iextract") for full
details on its use. It's most basic use is "j6iextract *.j6i" which will create
a JPEG (.jpg) file for each J6I file in the current directory.

	It is here that I found out how to convert the J6I files to JPEG.
	Take a look at:
	       ftp://ftp.itojun.org/pub/digi-cam/DC-2/dctools.0.04a.shar
	for a good collection of utilities to convert the J6Is to JPEGs.

	Thanks to Cliffs work on the RDC-300 support in gPhoto I was able
	to determine that the CRC used in the RDC-2E was that used in zmodem.

	Leon found the value of a frame NAK.  This makes retries possible
	when a frame comes in with an invalid CRC (or length).
