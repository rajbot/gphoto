gPhoto 0.4.2

December 05, 1999

For immidiate release.

The gPhoto project members announce the release of gPhoto 0.4.2, 
the GNU digital camera application, on December 5th 1999.

gPhoto is a digital camera software application for free Unix-like
systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and RedHat Linux, written by
Scott Fritzinger <scottf@scs.unr.edu> -- with assistance from
developers around the world. It is freely available and distributed on
the terms of the GNU General Public License. The GNU GPL is
intended to guarantee freedom to share and change software such
as gPhoto--to make sure it is free for all its users.

gPhoto 0.4.2 ships with 16 different camera libraries and supports 90+
different digital still camera models, from Agfa, Apple, Canon, Casio,
Chinon, Epson, Fuji, Hewlett Packard, Kodak, Konica, Minolta, Mustek,
Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Philips, Polaroid, Ricoh, Sanyo, and Sony.
Check http://www.gphoto.org/devel.html for a list of supported camera 
models.

Casio, Kodak, Minolta, Mustek, and Konica provide free, open camera
communication specifications. The gPhoto developers encourage other
vendors to also release specs to their latest and upcoming digital
camera models. It is always a great help for potential camera
customers to ask companies if they support gPhoto before you invest in
a camera.

The file ``CONTACTS'' in the distribution contains a list of companies
that you can write to asking for GPL drivers or camera specifications.
