This is a GPL letter that you can use to quickly get the open source message to
companies. Please try to be nice to the people you are talking to. They often
don't know what Linux is and will need to 10 about it with their managers
before they reply.

DO, however, ask them how things are progressing weekly unless they tell you
not to (then do it monthly ;)

---- LETTER ----

Dear <company name>

INTRO

I have recently purchased one of your <MODEL> digital cameras and am very happy with it.

OR

I am considering purchasing one of your <MODEL> digital cameras after hearing
some good reviews about it.

PUNCH LINE

However, I use the open, free GNU/Linux operating system[1] and note that your
company does not provide open driver support for UNIX systems. Therefore I
wonder what your companies stance on providing public access to the protocol
details so an open driver may be written as part of gPhoto[2], a program
included in the GNU[3] and GNOME[4] environments.

SWEET TALK

I realise this information may be regarded as proprietary, however I urge
<company> to consider the benefits[5] of supporting their customers in this
way. It would be unfortunate if I had to choose an inferior camera due to lack
of support from <company>. However, this is what I must do if these details
cannot be provided openly and allowing open, non-commercial third party drivers
to be written[2].

OR

I realise this information may be regarded as proprietary, however I urge
<company> to consider the benefits[5] of supporting their customers in this
way. It would be unfortunate if I was prevented from  an otherwise excellent
device on these grounds and I feel my loyalty toward <company> would be
greatly jeopardised as a result. However, this is what I must do if these
details cannot be provided openly to allow open, non-commercial third party
drivers to be written[2].

CLOSE

I look 1 to hearing good news from <company> and hope that you can support
users like myself in this way.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. Below are 
some reference points that are useful reading to provide a greater insight 
into this.

<Your name>
