				     GTKam

LATEST NEWS: I am currently porting gtkam to gtk+-2.0. Therefore, this package
is very likely to NOT compile. Please check out the gtkam-gtk-1 branch:

cvs update -r gtkam-gtk-1



Hi!

Thank you for using GTKam and therefore supporting our efforts in providing
free access to information on protocols of digital cameras.

Requirements
------------

GTKam is a GTK-frontend to gphoto2. Therefore, you need at least those two
libraries.

If you would like to access EXIF information, libexif(-gtk) must be installed
prior compilation of GTKam. Get libexif and libexif-gtk
from http://www.topfrose.de or directly from
http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/libexif.

Authors
-------

GTKam has originally been written by Scott Fritzinger <scottf@unr.edu>.
Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> rewrote everything using GTK's 
object oriented approach. That made it possible to introduce many new
features.
