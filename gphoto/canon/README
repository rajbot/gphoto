This driver is for the Canon PowerShot A50. It may work with similar
Canon models, such as the A5 and the A5 Zoom. It doesn't work with
the PowerShot 350. However, the PS350 uses a vaguely similar protocol,
so some parts of the sources can probably be shared.

The driver caches a lot of information. If the camera status changes
during a session or if the driver gets stuck for some other reason,
the caches can be manually flushed using "Configure camera".


Change history
==============

Version 3 (1-SEP-1999)
---------

 - lowered number of tries when initializing from 50 to 10 (50 was for
   experiments)
 - increased camera ID buffer to be large enough for PS350 responses
 - serial input is now flushed before testing or attempting synchronization
 - directories are now sorted alphabetically, implicitly ordering images by
   date
 - fixed a few memory leaks in directory handling
 - added arbitrary file download to Configure/Configure Camera (experimental;
   very fragile)


Version 2 (29-AUG-1999)
---------

 - integrated into gphoto-2.3.5 (from CVS)
 - added support for large directories (listing occupies > 1 message)
 - receive timeout is now raised from 1 to 10 seconds after first response
 - renamed a50_select_disk to a50_disk_info. It now returns disk capacity
   and available space.
 - completed CRC table
 - properly integrated into gPhoto
 - lots of cleanups


Version 1 (27-AUG-1999)
---------

 - a little bit of code cleanup, added a50.h, doc/, full recursive download
   in canon.c, and fixed a few documentation bugs, adjusted send/receive
   buffers
 - a50_send_msg incremented seq_tx when skipping retransissions while waiting
   for ACK


Version 0 (27-AUG-1999)
---------

 - initial release which demonstrates most functions in a way that's
   completely useless for gPhoto


To do
=====

- code structure is still pretty ugly. Things that absolutely need fixing:
  - command codes and fffbs are spread all over the place
  - "ping" (empty message) should probably be merged into normal message
    handling; perhaps also 03 message -> wait_for_ack can be merged too
  - psa50.c must not invoke GUI functions
  - change many fprintf(stderr,... to GUI calls or callbacks
- improve error handling: distinguish between severe and harmless errors
  (e.g. duplicate EOT vs. ten timeouts in a row)
- find out how to generate thumbnails
- find out how error recovery works (need traces)
- find out how higher bit rates work
- get traces for other operations:
   - idle period/restart (keepalive ?)
   - delete file
   - complete shutdown
   - get/set date
   - get battery status
   - upload file, create directory
- find out how to avoid blocking gPhoto during transfer
- improve the performance of the serial interface (fewer system calls)
- add initialization for other PS models
