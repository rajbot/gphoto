Hi!

Thank you for using GTKam and therefore supporting our efforts in providing
free access to information on protocols of digital cameras.

GTKam has originally been written by Scott Fritzinger <scottf@unr.edu>.
Lutz Müller <urc8@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> rewrote everything using GTK's 
object oriented approach. That made it possible to introduce many new
features.

The exif code has been found on http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif.
