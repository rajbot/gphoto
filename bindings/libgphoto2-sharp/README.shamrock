These are a few files borrowed from the Banshee build tree.

I hope that eventually abock will mature these and put
them in their own repo so that we can do a happy svn:externals :)

They are not licensed implicitly, but fall under the license that Banshee
specifies in it's COPYING file in both version control and the latest
release (which contains these .m4 files) under the MIT (X11) license.
