GNOCAM
------

GnoCam was born because I felt a need for a small but powerful frontend to 
gphoto2 for the GNOME desktop.

GnoCam actually is a quick hack, assembled by code from gtCam and several
GNOME applications like gedit, gftp, etc. See TODO for a list of things that
remain to do.

GnoCam requires at least the following libraries. Please get the latest 
version from http://www.gnome.org. 
 * gnome-libs
 * bonobo
 * gtkhtml
 * libglade
 * gnome-vfs
 * gconf
If you experience compilation errors, don't hesitate to report them.


If you feel that GnoCam is worth being developed further, send an e-mail to me.
