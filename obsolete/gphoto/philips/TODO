1) Macro off command doesn't seem to actually turn off the macro
   mode even though the camera reports OK.  Verify this happens
   with philips code too.

2) Is there any difference in the protocol when transferring
   image+sound data?

3) Fix picture uploading so that it isn't so darn slooooow.

4) Re-write philips_get_picture interface code that that it works
   and does what gPhoto wants it to.

5) Fix memo writing so that it works.

6) Finish configuration dialog box code so that it sets the
   controls based on the camera settings and then reads the
   controls and sets the camera when exiting.
