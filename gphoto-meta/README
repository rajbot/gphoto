About the mechanism:


1. run bootstrap.sh
===================

Downloads sources for all subprojects from CVS, configures them
locally, locally creates distribution tarballs in dist/.

Unfortunately, (due to usage of pkgconfig), we have to install
libgphoto2 before gtkam or gphoto2 will even configure.


2. run compileinstall.sh
===============================

Compiles the source packages from dist/ and installs them
to ${instroot} aka inst-root/.



========================================================================
The following had been planned, but is not quite feasible for a number
of reasons.
========================================================================


2. run autogen.sh
=================
Initializes automake based build system for all subprojects.


3. make gphoto-world
====================
(configure, make and install) for each project in turn.


4. make dist
============
create one huge tarball containing all subprojects
