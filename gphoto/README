This is a developer release of gPhoto (GNU Photo).

DESCRIPTION
	gPhoto is an universal, free GTK+ application that will allow
	downloading, saving, and manipulation of images from several 
	different digital camera models, or from the local harddrive.

	gPhoto has a basic command line interface, which is handy, 
	if you want to set up a web camera, and use gphoto in a 
	script, e.g. with Perl/PHP.  

	gPhoto sports a new HTML engine, that let's you create your
	gallery "themes" (HTML with special tags), and publish images 
	to the web.  A directory browse mode has also been implemented.

	gPhoto supports a wide array of digital camera models.  Visit
	http://www.gphoto.org/cameras.php3 for an updated list.

IMPORTANT NOTICES
	- Remove your old one from your $HOME/.gphoto/ directory
	  and then run gphoto and select your camera model.
	
	- For info about HTML gallery theme support, read THEMES (included).
	  For the latest theme specs., visit http://www.gphoto.org/pub/THEMES

	- For developer specs, please download the latest common interface 
	  specs from http://www.gphoto.org/pub/PROGRAMMERS

	* Konica Q M-100 library implemented by Phill Hugo <phill@gphoto.org>

FEATURES/CHANGES:
	Here are the major changes to 0.2:

	* Directory browse mode.
		In the "select model/port", select "Browse directory"
		then, whenever you click on "get index", a file selector
		pops up to ask you which directory to open. all images
		in the directory are opened, and thumbnails are generated
		for all of them... it's really handy if all the images are
		already archived on your hard drive and you want to find
		one... also, this can be used in the HTML gallery!

	* HTML gallery
		The addition of this is a BIGGIE!  This is really the first
		step in making gPhoto "more" than just a digicam utility.
		there is a "Default" theme included... to install it, 
		you MUST do a "make install" to copy all files to the
		correct location (/usr/share/gphoto/gallery/) after
		you "make" the package
	
		Using it:
			* Get the index first
			* Select the images to include in the gallery.
			* Go to "plugins->HTML Gallery"
			* Type in a name for the Gallery
			* Click on "Default" for the theme
			* "Change" the output directory to where you want
				it.
			* Click on "create"

		It will go through the motions, and tell you when it's
		done. it works the fastest in directory browse mode, 
		so try that first. or you can go straight for the jugular
		and use the camera (works fine there too! not as fast
		though)

		ALSO: it currently requires "sed" to do the parsing of
		the tags (until i nail down a faster way internally)
		so you need that on your machine.

	* Makefile in root source tree
		People don't need to change to the src directory anymore.
		Just change to the root source tree (gphoto-0.2-1) and
		type "make" then "make install".. There is also
		"make clean", and "make uninstall"

	* Command-line mode
		After building the gPhoto binary, type "gphoto -h" for
		command-line options. Here's the low-down:

	GNU Photo v.0.2
	Usage: gphoto [-h] [-n] [-s # filename] [-t # filename]
	              [-d #] [-l filename]
	        -n                      display the # of pictures
	        -s # filename           save image # as filename
	        -t # filename           save thumbnail # as filename
	        -d #                    delete image # from camera
	        -l filename             save live preview as filename
	        -h                      display this help screen 

	Only catch is you MUST run gphoto in graphical
	mode to initially set the camera library before
	running in command-line mode!

	A simple script set up can automate a lot of things
	(batch saving, webcam, delete all pics, etc..), so
	please send scripts to gphoto-devel@lists.styx.net,
	if you have written some.

        ------------------------------------------------------------
			
INSTALLATION:
	1) Untar/zip the archive by:

		tar zxvf gphoto.tgz

	   (but you knew that because you're reading this :-)

	2) Enter the gphoto-x-xx/src directory, and type 'make'.
	   This will build the camera model library, and install
	   them, and also build the gphoto binary.

	3) Type 'make install' to install the photopc library into
	   /usr/local/lib and the gPhoto executable into
	   /usr/local/bin

UNINSTALL:
	In the gphoto-x-xx directory, type 'make uninstall'

BUGS/PROBLEMS:
	* Crashes when closing images too fast. Being worked on.
	* Will occasionally not perform operation if camera is
	  in power-off mode and is turned on by gPhoto. Redo
	  the operation.
	* ???

	The gPhoto project is the easiest
	way for Digital Camera Companies
	to support potential customers.
	
	Emailing the gPhoto developers' list
	<gphoto-devel@gphoto.org> is a good
	place to start in procuring talents.

	Often it takes nothing more than open
	access to the technical details and a
	camera or two for testing/development.

	For each camera library, please see it's source code.  The authors
	have been contacted, and the author's permission was kindly granted
