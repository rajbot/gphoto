==Things to rename==

CameraFilesystem.GetFS -> GetFs
USB->Usb
Filesystem->FileSystem


==General Todo==

* More size checking:
** See if we can do comparisons with enum's?
** If not with compiled sources, perhaps by hand.
** amd64 uses double size longs, which means that these structs will NOT port.  How do other bindings handle this?
** See if endianness matters with pulling in unmanaged structs?

* Integrate my testing libraries
* Speed test .NET 1.1 marshalling of structs versus 2.0 fixed array sizes; perhaps the runtime upgrade is worth the speed change?

* Finish working with CameraStorage*
** Return all storage objects rather than just the first.
** Handle setting where number of describeable storage devices != 1

* Write base classes that derive from Camera and CameraFile to be "frontend" APIs
